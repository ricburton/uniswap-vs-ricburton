Background
A. €ryptocurtency

Each unit of cryptocurrency, “virtual or digital money,” is. either called a “coin” or a
“token.” The terms coins (or “convertible coins”} and “tokens” are often used interchangeably,
however, while coins - the most notable of which is Bitcoin - have a stated or discernible monetary
value;* by contrast,-tokens are better thought of as “digital assets” that “fluctuate in value as any
comniodity, would.” Sec. & Exeh, Commn. v. Telegram Grp Inc., 448 F Supp-3d 352, 358 (SDNY
2020). As a practical matter, both coins and tokens are eryptocurrency that "nay be used to pay
for goods or’services[ ] or held for investment."4

Cryptocurrencies operate via a record-keeping technology called “blockchain,” which
conspicuously (ie., viewable by anyone) and permanently stores every transaction, The
blockchain mechanism allows for the use. of crypto-assets as secure stores of value and media of
exchange that do not. rely on a centralized government or singular conirol. Cryptocurrency-
transactions may occur directly bétween parties via “decentralized eryptocurrency exchanges”
(DEX), which ‘allow users to trade: one’ cryptocutrericy for another, or for traditional currérictes
such as U.S. dollars.4

Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurency. is an example of a crypto-asset that
serves primarily as a medium of exchange. Ether,” another popular crypto-asset, “operates on
Ethereum. which is a different blockchain from Bitcoin, and has some additional features, but

otherwise functions similarly,

B. Factual Background.

As the Court.is bound to accept the facts alleged by the non-moving party as true, for
purposes of the CPLR § 3211 dismissal motion (/F Capital Advisors, LLC v Lightstone:Group,
LLC, 25 NY3d.759, 762, 16 NYS3d 222 citing Leon v.Martinez, 84 NYS2d 83, 87,614 NYS2d
972 [1994)), Plaintiff Burton is‘a. software developer, ‘designer and entrepreneur, and the founder
‘of “Balance,” an Etheréum blockchaii wallet startup. Defendant Adams is fourider and CEO of
“Uniswap,” a DEX software that “improves the functionality” of trading on. the Ethereum
blockchain’s.platform. While Uniswap is currently the largest DEX on Ethereum, when the.parties
met. in-2018, Uniswap was “little more than an idea.” Burton loaned Adams money and office
space. within Balance’s offices to support Adams in creating Uniswap, including: “technical and
design advice,” and $25,000 for software-development, rent, and other costs.

As consideration for Burton’s assistance, the parties corally agreed that Burtom would be
given the.option.to be an early investor-in Uniswap, and, but for that oral agreement, Burton would
not have provided the support that Adams relied upon:

At some point, Adams offered Burton a deal “term sheel,” however, while Burton
confirméd his continued interest in investing, he indicated he would now only do-so after Adams
had found a “lead investor to set'the terms aiid price the deal.” Burton thereafter financed Adams’s
flight to San Francisco t6 “pitch Uniswap:toe Paradi gm,” a well-known blockchain-focused venture
capital firm. Paradigm went on to seed $1 million into Adams’s. then-still-unincorporated
enterprise, now Universal, which, at the time of briefing, was valued at.$10 million. Since then,.
Uniswap has seen a major increase in trading, processing over $110 billion in volume, and

“increasing to the tune of more than $1 billion daily.”

Analvsis
A. Contract Claim

As noted in the Jnterim Decision, the basic requirements for contract:formation are (1) at
least two parties with legal capacity te contract, (2) mutual assent to. the terms ofthe contract, and
(3) consideration (Restatement [Second] of Contracts §§ 9, 12,23). The basic elements of a breach.
of contract cause of action are (1) formation of a contract between plaintiff and defendant, (2)
performance by plaintiff, (3).defendant’s failure to perform, (4) resulting damage (Riccio p
Genworth Fin., 184 AD3d 590,.124:NYS3d.370 [2d Dept 20201).

In analyzing the first step, the parties’ legal capacity to contract, this Court accepted the
Burton’s statement that the parties reached an “oral agteement,” bearing in mind that assent to
such an agreement may: také. the forin of written or spoken words (express contract) or conduct:
manifesting agreement (contract implied-in-fact) (Miller v Schloss, 218 NY 400, 113 NE 337
[1916]). Thus, an oral agreement can be enforceable as long as the terms are cleat and definite
and the conduct of the parties evinces mutual assent "sufficiently definite to assure that the parties
are truly in agreement with respect.to all material terms" (Matter of Express Indus. & Term, Corp.
‘y New York State Dept. of Transp., 93 NY2d 584, 589 [1999]), A contract also may be implied
where inferences can be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case and the intention ‘of
the parties as indicated by their conduct. However, not all terms of a contract need be fixed with
absolute. certainty. Thus, the.doctrine of indefinitenese should not be used to "defeat the reasonable
expectations of the parties in entering into the contract" (Cobble Hill Nursing Home v Henry &
Warren Corp., 74 NY¥2d 475, 483 [1989], cert denied 498 US 816 [1990]). Where "there may exist.
an objective method for supplying the missing terms heeded to calculate the alleged compensation

owed plaintiff,"-an oral agreement is not; as’a matter of law, unenforceable for indefiniteness (see,

4 of 8
INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 37 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 05/20/2022

e.g. Basu v Alphaber Mgt. LEC, 127 AD3d 450, 450 [ist. Dept 2015]; Abrams Realty Corp. v
Ele, 279 AD2d 261 [Ist Dept 2001], fy denied 96 N.Y.2d 745 [2001)).

The /nferim Decision noted, however, that when, as here; acceptance. is expressly qualified
with conditions, it is generally treated as either a rejection and counteroffer or an agreement to
agree. (Roer v Cross Catv. Méd. Ctr. Corp., 83 AD2d 861, 441 NYS2d 844 [2d Dept 1981]; 470.
BPR Carp. v Chmelecki Asset Mem, ine., 51 AD3d7 15, 859 NYS2d 209 [2d Dept 2008): Carmon
v Soleh Boneh Ltd., 206 AD2d 450, 450, 614 NYS2d 555, 556 [2d Dept 1994]). Thus, this Court.
concluded that, even if the parties initially reached what could have been an enforceable: oral
contract, Burton rejected that agreement by declining ‘the ptoposed term sheet unless and until
Adams found a lead investor to set the: term: The question then became whether a second
eriforceabie express otal contract was formed thereafter, i¢.,, of whether the parties’ course of
conduct manifested a new implied-in-fact contract when Adams accepted Burton's financed flight
te San Francisco to “pitch Uniswap to Paradigm.”

This-Court now finds that even if such conduct suggested.a potential new implied-in-fact
agreement, that new agreement would again be too indefinite to give rise to an enforceable
contract. There has. been no suggestion that Plaintiff will ‘be able, after discovery, to show proof
of key material terms, and it would agaiti anticipate future approval, preparation and execution of
documents. ‘In brief, Plaintiff has-provided no hint of a prospective basis or standard for deciding
whether the-agreement had been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy. (Kofchins v Evolution
Mkts, Inc., 3.1 NY3d 100, 73 NYS3d 319 [2018]; Foros Advisor LLC y Digital Globe, Inc. 333 F
Supp3d 354, 360 [SDNY 2018]; 7. Groppa Pools, Ine. y Massello, 106 AD3d 722, 712 [2d Dept

2013]; Schuckman Realty v Marine Midland Bank, 244 .D2d_400,.401 [2d Dept 1997)]).

B. ‘Statute of Frauds and the
Doffman Exceptiori

Adams further argued.that contract formation was. prohibited by New York's “Statute of Frauds,”
codified in General Obligations Law Sections 5-701 and 5-703, which provides, with many exceptions, that
cerlain agreements, promises, or undertakings are void unless in writing, Section 5-701(a) applies the
Statute of Frauds to “a contract to. pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a... business:
opportunity, business, ... or an friterest therein ..:” Burton argues, however, that he also “spent countless
hours in front-of a whiteboard” providing Adams with “technical and design advice” when “the Uniswap
protocol and project were still in proof'of concept form.”

In Dorfinan v Refki, 144 AD 34 10, 16, 19 ¢ Ist Dept 2016) (“Dorfman”), the First Department
noted that the services therein, where not merely “developing: materials. to secure investor backing,
recruiting engineers,” but further “develop[ed] the details of how [the company’s] software. . . would be
‘architected,”” and accordingly found that. they consisted of more thar just assisting in the negotiation or
corisuimmation of the business opportunity. ‘Thus, the First Department ruled that the oral agreement therein:
was not void pursuant to Section 5-701 (ay(l 0). |

Here, however, even ‘if the Derfinan exception applied, and the agreement was not void per se
pursuant to. New York’s “Statute. of Frauds, i¢ would still suffer fiom the same uncertainty. and. rejection-
of-offer-issues that precluded it from being deemed an enforceable contract.

C. Unjust Enrichment, Quantum Meruit, and
Reasonable Value of Services.

Under New York law, guaritum meruit.and unjust enrichment are not separate causes of
action and are therefore andlyzed under the same principles (Assoc. Morte. Bankers, Inc. v
Calcon Mut. Morte. LEC, 159 F Supp 3d 324, 33 7 [EDNY 2016]. As noted in the Juterim
Decision, inorder to set forth acclaim in quantum meruil, a plaintiff must establish (1) the
performance of the services in good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person:to

whont they are renderéd, (3) an éxpectation of compensation, anid (4) the reasonable value of the

6 of 8
INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 37 : RECEIVED NYSCEF: 05/20/2022

services (see, e.g., Mirance Contracting, Inc, v Perel,’57 AD3d 956, 871 NYS2d 310 [2d Dept
2008); Geraldi y-Melamid, 212 AD2d 575, 622 NYS2d 742 [2d Dept 1995]; Tesser v Allboro:
Equip. Co., 302 AD2d 589, 590, 756 NYS2d 253, asd [2d Dept 2003]. An unjust enrichment
claims rooted in “the equitable principle that a person shall not be-allowed to enrich himself
unjustly-at the expense of another” (Miller v Schloss, 218 N.Y. 400, 407, 113 N.E. 337 [1916]),
and a viable claim merely tequires that the plaintiff allege “that (1) the other party was enriched,
(2) at.that party's expense, and.(3) that it is against equity and good conscience to permit the
other party to retain what is sought to be recovered” (Mandarin Trading Lid. v Wildenstein, 16
NY3d 173, 182, 919 NYS2d 465. The Jnterim Decision noted that the pleadings herein were
sufficient to establisti the first three of those-elements of an unjust enrichment claim, at least for
purposes of defeating the instant dismissal motion, but granted the parties leave to brief the issue.
of calculating the “reasonable value of services” in connection with assisting.a cryptocurrency
startup, with respect to unjust enrichment and. quantum meruit claims.”

Without a contract to govern. the terms of payment for services, Adams argues that the
measure of compensation is generally.based.on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the number
of hours of services (see; ¢.g., Carlino v Kaplan. 139 F Supp2d 563, 566 [SDNY 2001]; Wong v.
Michael Kennedy, P.C., 853 F Supp 73, 81-82 [EDNY 1994]. There are, however, exceptions.
where, even absent a.contract, industry conventions dictate that the value of sérvices may be based

upon the value of the product. The question presented was whether the facts and/or industry

5 The Interim Decision rejected Defendant argument that Plaintiff could not plead quasi contract and breach
of contract in the alternative, where as here there is a bora fide disputé as to the existence of a contract
(Polley v Plainsinin Corp., 8. AD2d 638, 186 NYS2d 295 [2d Dept 1959]; Krigsfeld v Feldman, 115 AD3d.
712, 982 NYS2d 487 [2d Dept 2014]; 444 Sales, Ine. v Creative Bath. Products, Ine., 58 AD3d 6, 867
NYS2d 169 [2d Dept 2008]).

7 of 8

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 37 ; RECEIVED NYSCEF: 05/20/2022

conventions within the start-up field, or perhaps more. specifically emerging cryptocurrency field,
where-vast fortunes may be made or lost, warrant such an exception.

At stake is the'difference between the Complaint’s allegations of Burton’s ‘provision of services”
and funds totaling $25,000, versus his claim for $100 million in “restitution” under unjust enrichment or
quantum meruit theories. There remains a question of fact whether the “reasonable value” of services
should be limited to a calculation based upon hours and costs purportedly spent (Collins Tuttle -& Co. v.
Leucadia, inc., 153 AD2d: 526,526. [1st Dept 1989]; Hindsight Sots., LEC v-Citigtoup Inc., 53. F Supp 3d
747, 776-77 [SDNY 2014]; Caribbean Direct, inc. v Dubset ELC, 100 A.D3d 510, 511 [1st Dept 2012]),.
or whether in fact industry standards, and/or the parties discussions or conduct reflects some other
reasonable value of services. The parties will procéed with discovery on this narrowed issue. Burton
argues that $100-million is the’ reasonable value of his roughly $25,000 in cash. and. critical
developmental support. The parties: shall proceed with discovery. on that issue of whether their
industry and/or their communications or conduct support a finding consistent or inconsistent with
that argument.
