RICHARD BURTON,
Plaintiff, COMPLAINT
Index No: ___________
- vs -
HAYDEN ADAMS
Defendant.
___________________________________________
Plaintiff Richard Burton (“Mr. Burton”), for his Complaint against Defendant Hayden
Adams (“Mr. Adams”), alleges as follows:
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
1. This lawsuit seeks damages for breach of contract, and, in the alternative,
restitution for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit, all in connection with the
development of Uniswap, a multi-billion-dollar, New York-based software and
cryptocurrency enterprise used to trade cryptocurrency and digital assets.
2. Plaintiff Richard Burton provided critical financial and other support to
Defendant Hayden Adams, a Uniswap founder and its current CEO, for the early
development of Uniswap.
3. When Mr. Burton helped Mr. Adams, Mr. Adams had no capital, no office,
and no business. Uniswap was little more than an idea. Uniswap was not fully functional
software. Mr. Burton provided critical early assistance to Mr. Adams for business reasons

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 2 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/24/2021

2
and with the hope, expectation and understanding, based on communications with Mr.
Adams, that Mr. Burton would have the opportunity to benefit financially from the support
and assistance Mr. Burton provided to Mr. Adams.
4. Among other things, it was understood and agreed between Mr. Adams and
the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff would be given the opportunity to invest in Uniswap at such
time as Uniswap took a concrete form into which investment could be made. Mr. Adams
made it clear that Mr. Burton would benefit from the investment’s potential appreciation
in value and any subsequent issue of cryptocurrency tokens by Uniswap.
5. Once Uniswap began to attract the attention of institutional investors,
however, Adams refused to allow Plaintiff to invest. In so doing Mr. Adams deprived the
Plaintiff of what would have been an investment return currently worth well in excess of
one hundred million dollars. Mr. Adams instead reserved that opportunity for himself.
6. But for the agreement by Mr. Adams to give Plaintiff the opportunity to
invest in Uniswap, Plaintiff would not have provided the significant support that he offered
to, and that was accepted by, Mr. Adams, including money, office space, and design
advice.
7. In short, Mr. Adams was enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars, at least
in part, at Plaintiff’s expense. It would be against equity and good conscience to permit
Adams to retain all of the profits of his ownership in Uniswap without payment to Plaintiff
of a fair and equitable portion of them.

THE PARTIES
8. Plaintiff Richard Burton is a natural person who is a software developer,
designer and entrepreneur who currently resides in San Francisco, California. At all times
relevant to this dispute he was a resident of New York County, in New York State.
9. Defendant Hayden Adams is also a natural person who, on information and
belief, is a citizen and resident of Kings County, in New York State. Mr. Adams can be
served with the Summons and Complaint at 101 Bedford Avenue, Apt. A502, Brooklyn,
New York 11211.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
10. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CPLR § 503 because Mr. Adams
is, on information and belief, a resident of Kings County, New York at the time this lawsuit
is commenced and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim
occurred in Kings County, New York.
11. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Mr. Adams pursuant to CPLR §
301 because he is a resident of Kings County, New York and, furthermore, because the
Complaint arises out of the transaction of business in New York state.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
12. Uniswap bills itself as “the largest decentralized trading and automated
market making protocol (often called a DEX, Decentralized Exchange) on Ethereum.
Since launching in 2018, Uniswap Protocol has processed over $110 billion in volume
and increasing to the tune of more than $1 billion daily.”1

13. Hayden Adams is a founder and The Chief Executive Officer of the business
behind Uniswap, which is the trading name of Universal Navigation, Inc.
14. Uniswap’s success has been meteoric. This success was by no means a
forgone conclusion and relied upon, and would not have happened but for, the help,
assistance and investments of others, including Mr. Burton.
15. Mr. Burton first met Mr. Adams in the spring of 2018 in New York City.
16. Mr. Burton is the founder of Balance, an Ethereum blockchain wallet startup.
17. At the time that Mr. Burton and Mr. Adams first met, the Uniswap protocol
had yet to be finalized or deployed, nor had any corporate entity pertaining to the Uniswap
protocol been formed by Mr. Adams. At the time, Uniswap was a rough idea, in need of
development, financing, and office space. Mr. Adams accepted Mr. Burton’s offer to
provide assistance. As consideration for this assistance, Mr. Adams agreed that Mr.
Burton would have the ability to be an early investor in Uniswap.
18. For the next several months, throughout the summer of 2018, Mr. Adams
worked on Uniswap daily in Balance’s offices.
19. Knowing Mr. Adams was running low on funds, and consistent with the oral
contract described above in paragraph 17 of this Complaint, Mr. Burton gave Mr. Adams
money to help support his efforts and allow him to continue with development [on more
than one occasion].
20. During these months, Mr. Burton spent countless hours in front of a
whiteboard with Mr. Adams helping to think through the project and pitch the project to
prospective investors. When Mr. Adams ran out of grant money and wanted to present
Uniswap to potential investors at Paradigm, Mr. Burton supported him.

21. Mr. Burton was the first person to promote, share and Tweet about Uniswap
to help promote it. He did whatever was possible to help Hayden connect with the right
people to work and partner with.
22. Mr. Burton paid Mr. Adams $10,000 to do software development work for
Balance. Mr. Adams never performed this work. Mr. Burton wrote off the expense and
told Mr. Adams to use the funds for expenses – and to focus on shipping Uniswap. This
money was an investment in Mr. Adams and in the Uniswap protocol, however the
payment may have been characterized at that time.
23. Mr. Burton also provided Mr. Adams with money for travel expenses, as well
as technical and design advice, consistent with the contract previously reached and
described above in paragraph 17 of this Complaint.
24. As Uniswap’s development progressed over the summer of 2018, Mr.
Adams was running out of money. Mr. Burton sent him $15,000 to help him cover rent and
costs.
25. At numerous points during the summer of 2018, Mr. Adams continued to
assure Mr. Burton that in exchange for his support, he would be given a role in any to-be-
formed company, as well as an opportunity to be an early investor if and when a lead
investor for the Uniswap project was identified.
26. Mr. Burton specifically inquired on numerous occasion as to when there
would be an opportunity to invest in exchange for his support. Mr. Adams assured Mr.
Burton that this opportunity would be afforded to him. These assurances were provided to
Mr. Burton in writing, in person and on voice-calls. Mr. Adams sent Mr. Burton a term

sheet and Mr. Burton confirmed the desire and intention to invest when Mr. Adams had
found a lead investor to set the terms and price the deal.
27. As part of the process of helping locate a lead investor, Mr. Burton sent Mr.
Adams additional cash so he could fly to San Francisco and pitch Uniswap to Paradigm,
a well-known blockchain focused venture capital firm.
28. At the time that Mr. Burton provided Mr. Adams financial and personal
assistance, the Uniswap protocol and project were still in proof of concept form, had not
been formally deployed, had no trading volume and, as a practical matter, no then-present
financial value.
29. Mr. Burton did not provide this help to Mr. Adams on a purely ex gratia basis,
but with the understanding and expectation that he would be given an opportunity to
benefit economically from any future success that Uniswap enjoyed, including the ability
to be an early investor in the protocol.
30. Specifically, Mr. Adams initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in
Uniswap at a $10 million valuation for $100,000. When Mr. Burton attempted to accept
that offer to invest, he was told that he could not.
31. In spite the substantial assistance Mr. Burton provided Mr. Adams, he was
denied the ability and opportunity to invest in and to be part of the company as he and
Mr. Adams had agreed from the outset.
32. Venture capital firm Paradigm was the only investor allowed to initially
invest. Paradigm invested by providing Mr. Adams and the eventually-formed Uniswap
entity with $1 million in seed funding at a $10 million valuation. It participated on a pro-

rata basis and, on information and belief, has seen an uplift on the value of its investment
such that if it sold its interest today it may be able to do so for over $1 billion.
33. Mr. Adams’s failure and refusal to allow Mr. Burton to invest $100,000 at a
$10 million valuation thus translates into damages of, at minimum, $100 million. This
amount inured to the benefit of Mr. Adams, at Mr. Burton’s expense.
34. But for Mr. Burton’s belief that he would be allowed to invest in and benefit
from his support of Mr. Adams and the Uniswap project, Mr. Burton would not have
provided the measure of assistance that was offered and accepted by Mr. Adams.
35. The relationship between Mr. Burton and Mr. Adams was one that caused
reliance by Mr. Burton on Mr. Adams’ conduct and statements and induced Mr. Burton to
provide continued support.
COUNT I: BREACH OF CONTRACT
36. Plaintiff incorporates paragraph 1 through 35 of this Complaint as if set forth
here in their entirety.
37. The agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant described above was a
binding an enforceable contract.
38. Plaintiff offered to assist Defendant with the further development, launch
and capitalization of Uniswap.
39. Defendant accepted Plaintiff’s offer to assist.
40. As valuable consideration for the contract described herein, Defendant
agreed to give Plaintiff the opportunity to be an early investor in Uniswap.
41. Plaintiff fully performed his contractual obligations.

42. Defendant breached the contract by failing and refusing to grant Plaintiff the
ability to invest when he attempted to do so.
43. Plaintiff has been damaged by Plaintiff’s breach in an amount of money
equivalent to the lost investment opportunity described above in paragraph 33.
COUNT II: QUASI-CONTRACT/UNJUST ENRICHMENT
44. Plaintiff incorporates paragraph 1 through 43 of this Complaint as if set forth
here in their entirety and pleads this count two seeking an equitable remedy in the
alternative to the legal relief and money damages that Count I seeks.
45. Defendant was enriched by Mr. Burton’s technical, financial and other
assistance, all of which played a critical role in the development and launch of Uniswap.
46. Defendant was enriched at Mr. Burton’s expense.
47. But for the assistance and benefits provided by Mr. Burton to Mr. Adams,
Uniswap might never have had the opportunity to be the massive financial success it is
today, a benefit and enrichment that Mr. Adams has enjoyed, at Mr. Burton’s expense.
48. It would be against equity and good conscience to allow Mr. Adams to retain
the full benefit of Mr. Burton’s assistance by retaining the amount Mr. Burton seeks to
recover in this lawsuit.
COUNT III: QUASI CONTRACT/QUANTUM MERUIT
49. Plaintiff incorporates paragraph 1 through 48 of this Complaint as if set forth
here in their entirety, pleading this Count III in the alternative to Counts I and II, and pleads
this count three seeking an equitable remedy in the alternative to the legal relief and
money damages that Count I seeks.

50. Mr. Burton performed the services described in this Complaint for Mr.
Adams in good faith.
51. Mr. Adams accepted the services that Mr. Burton provided.
52. Mr. Burton reasonably expected to be compensated for his services in the
form of an opportunity to be an early investor in Uniswap.
53. The reasonable value of Mr. Burton’s compensation can be readily
calculated and is equal to, at a minimum, $100 million, the value of the investment which
Mr. Burton was not allowed to make, and the benefit of which Mr. Adams retained for
himself at Mr. Burton’s expense.
WHEREFORE, and for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff seeks the following relief:
A. On Count I, money damages in an amount no less than $100 million;
B. On Count II, restitution from Mr. Adams in the value of the investment
opportunity that Plaintiff was denied and that Mr. Adams retained, in an amount no less
than $100 million;
C. On Count III, restitution from Mr. Adams in the current value of the
investment opportunity that Plaintiff was denied and that Mr. Adams retained, in an
amount no less than $100 million;
D. On all Counts, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in the highest
amount allowed by law;
E. On all Counts, costs of suit, including attorneys fees;
F. Any such other and further relief that this Court deems fair and equitable.
JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This Court should dismiss the complaint of plaintiff Richard Burton (“Burton”)
in its entirety. Burton seeks a windfall of “$100 million” on the basis of vague and
indefinite allegations that defendant Hayden Adams (“Adams”) orally promised him
the “ability to be an early investor in Uniswap[.]”1 (Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 17.) Even
under the liberal pleading rules that govern a motion to dismiss, the three causes of
action—breach of oral contract, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit—are all fatally
flawed.
Burton’s first cause of action for breach of contract fails as a matter of law
because the alleged oral contract is too vague and indefinite. The complaint does not
set forth the material terms of the alleged contract, such as the price, quantity, or
specific timing of Burton’s opportunity to invest in “Uniswap.
” It is not even clear if
Burton expected to receive shares in a future company which Adams later incorporated
(i.e., Uniswap Labs), or if he expected tokens or other digital assets associated with the
Uniswap software. Without sufficiently definite contract terms that were agreed upon
by the parties, Burton completely fails to adequately allege an enforceable oral contract.
Even if there were an oral contract—which there was not—the complaint does
not allege that Adams breached any oral promise to provide Burton with an early
investment opportunity. To the contrary, Burton acknowledges that Adams provided
1 The complaint does not define “Uniswap”, but uses the term interchangeably to refer both to a
software protocol for a decentralized trading platform and a company called Universal Navigation,
Inc. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 1, 12, 28, 32.) For clarity, unless directly quoting from the complaint, this
brief uses the term “Uniswap” to refer to the open-sourced software protocol, and the term
“Uniswap Labs” to refer to the company, Universal Navigation, Inc.

Burton with a “term sheet” and that Burton declined to invest at that time. (See id. ¶ 26.)
Based on those facts alone, there was no breach. Beyond all of this, to the extent that
Burton’s claims are based on Burton’s alleged promise to assist Adams with identifying,
negotiating, or pitching Uniswap or Uniswap Labs to third party investors, the claims
are barred by the statute of frauds.
Burton’s second and third causes of action for unjust enrichment and quantum
meruit also should be dismissed. It is well established that these equitable claims may
not be used as a backdoor to obtain the benefit of an otherwise unenforceable contract.
But that is precisely what Burton seeks to do. Rather than seek only the reasonable
value of any alleged services, Burton seeks at least $100 million on his theories for
unjust enrichment and quantum meruit and bases those claims on the exact same
factual allegations as his contract claim. As support for his outlandish monetary
demand, Burton alleges that he gave Adams about $25,000 for software development,
rent, and other costs in addition to unspecified technical and design advice. Burton
makes no attempt to identify the specific services that he allegedly provided or their
reasonable value.
For these reasons, Adams’ motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice
should be granted.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND2
Defendant Hayden Adams is “a founder” and “Chief Executive Officer” of
Uniswap Labs. (Compl. ¶ 13.) The company is alleged to be behind a decentralized on-
line exchange powered by a software known as “Uniswap”, which permits users to
“trade cryptocurrencies and digital assets.” (Id. ¶¶ 1, 12, 13.)
Plaintiff Richard Burton “is the founder of Balance, an Ethereum3 blockchain
wallet startup.” (Id. ¶ 16.)
“Mr. Burton first met Mr. Adams in the spring of 2018 in New York City.” (Id. ¶
15.) At the time they met, Uniswap Labs had not yet been formed and the Uniswap
software protocol was “little more than an idea” under development. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 17.)
After meeting in the spring of 2018, Burton alleges that he and Adams entered
into an “oral contract” “described [] in Paragraph 17 of th[e] Complaint.
” (Id. ¶¶ 17, 19,
23.) Paragraph 17 claims that Uniswap was “in need of development, financing, and
office space,” and alleges that, “Mr. Adams accepted Mr. Burton’s offer to provide
assistance.” (Id. ¶ 17.) Even assuming these facts are true for the purposes of this
motion, the complaint nowhere describes Burton’s purported offer or the specific terms
of this supposed oral contract, such as the price or quantity of Burton’s investment
opportunity, the specific timing of Burton’s investment opportunity, or the extent and
scope of Burton’s promised assistance. Instead, the complaint merely asserts that “[a]s

consideration for [his] assistance, Mr. Adams agreed that Mr. Burton would have the
ability to be an early investor in Uniswap.” (Id.)
After the formation of the purported oral contract, Burton allegedly provided
assistance to Adams in the spring and summer of 2018. At one point, the complaint
alleges Burton “paid Mr. Adams $10,000 to do software development work for Balance”
and “wrote off the expense” when Adams allegedly failed to perform these services.
(Id. ¶ 22.) At another point, the complaint alleges Burton “provided Mr. Adams with
money for travel expenses, as well as technical and design advice,” which Burton
asserts in a conclusory fashion was “consistent with the [alleged oral] contract[.]” (Id. ¶
23 (italics added).) And, during “the summer of 2018”, Burton allegedly provided
Adams with “$15,000 to help him cover rent and [other] costs[.]” (Id. ¶ 24.) Over this
period, Adams allegedly assured Burton that “he would be given a role in any to-be-
formed company, as well as an opportunity to be an early investor if and when a lead
investor for the Uniswap project was identified.” (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.)
Although Burton claims that Adams breached an oral contract “to give [him] the
opportunity to be an early investor in Uniswap” (id. ¶ 40), he admits that “Mr. Adams
sent Mr. Burton a term sheet[.]” (Id. ¶ 26.) The complaint does not allege that this term
sheet was unsatisfactory or otherwise inconsistent with Adams’ purported earlier oral
promise to provide Burton with an early investment opportunity. Instead, Burton
implicitly acknowledges that he passed on the investment opportunity in the term sheet
at a time when Uniswap had “no then-present financial value” (id. ¶ 28), and expressed
a “desire and intention to invest [at some future date] when Mr. Adams had found a

5
lead investor to set the terms and price the deal.” (Id. ¶ 26.)
Subsequently, Adams allegedly “pitch[ed] Uniswap to Paradigm, a well-known
blockchain focused venture capital firm.” (Id. ¶ 27.) “Paradigm invested by providing
Mr. Adams and the eventually-formed Uniswap entity with $1 million in seed funding
at a $10 million valuation.” (Id. ¶ 32.)
After Uniswap Labs “attract[ed] the attention of institutional investors”, Burton
“attempted to accept” Adams’ earlier “offer to invest[.]” (Id. ¶¶ 5, 30.) At that point,
Burton “was told that he could not” invest. (Id.) Ultimately, Uniswap became the
“largest decentralized trading and automated market making protocol . . . on
Ethereum[.]” (Id. ¶ 12.)
Seeking to piggy-back on the “meteoric” success of Uniswap, Burton now claims
that he has suffered a minimum of $100 million in damages. (Id. ¶¶ 14, 33.) He does
not explain the factual basis for this damages calculation, except to assert that Adams
“initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation for
$100,000.” (Id. ¶ 30.) Burton does not state when this alleged offer was made, or
explain the factual basis for a $100,000 purchase price, or a $10 million valuation.
Burton also claims that Adams was unjustly enriched by his support and that Burton is
entitled to “a fair and equitable portion” of Adams’ success. (Id. ¶ 7.) He seeks “money
damages” or “restitution” “in an amount no less than $100 million” under each of his
three causes of action. (Id., Prayer for Relief.)

LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to dismiss under New York Civil Practice Law (“CPLR”) 3211 may be
brought on the grounds that the asserted complaint or cause(s) of action fail to state a
claim. CPLR 3211(a)(7). Similarly, under CPLR 3211(a)(5), a motion may be brought on
the grounds that a cause of action is subject to the statute of frauds. “The test of the
sufficiency of a pleading is ‘whether it gives sufficient notice of the transactions,
occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences intended to be proved and whether
the requisite elements of any cause of action known to our law can be discerned from its
averments.’” Nasca v. Sgro, 130 A.D.3d 588, 588 (2d Dep’t 2015) (citations omitted).
Although allegations in the pleadings are generally accepted as true, “allegations
consisting of bare legal conclusions, as well as factual claims either inherently incredible
or flatly contradicted by documentary evidence, are not entitled to such consideration.”
Kliebert v. McKoan, 228 A.D.2d 232, 232 (1st Dep’t 1996).
ARGUMENT
I. The First Cause of Action for Breach of Oral Contract Should Be Dismissed for
Multiple Reasons
A. The Alleged Oral Contract Lacks Definite and Certain Terms
Burton’s first cause of action for breach of an oral contract fails because he has
not pleaded—and cannot plead—the material terms of the alleged contract. “Before a
party may obtain redress for breach of a promise, the promise must be sufficiently
certain and specific to ascertain the parties’ intentions and the terms of the agreement.”

When, as here, “a plaintiff alleges the existence of an oral agreement, he ‘faces a
heavier burden’[] [t]o ensure that parties are not trapped into surprise contractual
obligations.” Delaney v. Bank of America Corp., 908 F. Supp. 2d 498, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)
(citations omitted) (emphasis added).) “[V]ague allegations suggesting that there may
have been an agreement do not suffice.” Reznick v. Bluegreen Resorts Mgt., Inc., 154
A.D.3d 891, 893 (2d Dep’t 2017).
“‘[I]f the terms of the agreement are so vague and
indefinite that there is no basis or standard for deciding whether the agreement had
been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy, and no means by which such terms may be
made certain, then there is no enforceable contract.’” Foros Advisors LLC v. Digital Globe,
Inc., 333 F. Supp. 3d 354, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); see also 2004 McDonald Ave. Realty, LLC v.
2004 McDonald Ave. Corp., 50 A.D.3d 1021, 1021 (2d Dep’t 2008) (“[D]efiniteness as to
material matters is of the very essence of contract law.’”) (Citations omitted)).
It is proper to dismiss a breach of oral contract claim at the pleading stage where
the terms of the alleged agreement are not sufficiently pled. For example, in Brembo,
S.P.A. v. T.A.W. Performance LLC, 176 A.D.3d 535, 536 (1st Dep’t 2019), the defendant
alleged that the plaintiff had “promise[d] to appoint [the] defendant as its exclusive
distributor in meetings and through correspondence.” The Appellate Division upheld
the trial court’s dismissal of the defendant’s counterclaim for breach of contract, ruling
that the alleged oral agreement was insufficiently “definitive in its material terms so as
to be enforceable.” Id. The Appellate Division reasoned that “[n]o terms were agreed
upon when the plaintiff allegedly made the promise: not the duration of the agreement,
not the pricing of [the] plaintiff’s parts, and not any other term governing the alleged

[agreement].” Id.
Similarly here, Burton’s cause of action for breach of oral contract rests on vague
and indefinite allegations that Adams accepted Burton’s “offer to provide assistance”
and in exchange, “Mr. Adams agreed that Mr. Burton would have the ability to be an
early investor in Uniswap.” (Comp. ¶ 17.)4 As in Brembo, Burton—relying on alleged
assurances by Adams—fails to plead the material terms of the consideration he would
provide, including the “scope of the expected” assistance, the time commitment, or
material terms such as price and duration. Brembo, 176 A.D.3d at 536. Burton does not
even specify if he was promised shares in a future company (Uniswap Labs), or future
tokens or other digital assets associated with Uniswap (the software protocol). In any
event, the complaint “is silent with respect to the amount [Burton would be allowed to
invest], the exercise price [at which Burton would be allowed to invest], or the date on
which [Burton] could [invest].” Kunica v. St. Jean Financial, Inc., 1998 WL 437153,

(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1998); see also Canzona v. Atanasio, 118 A.D.3d 837, 839 (2d Dep’t 2014)
(“the plaintiff failed to plead the material terms of the alleged oral loan agreement by
which the defendants agreed to repay or reimburse him for his payment of
expenditures”).
4 Burton makes clear throughout his complaint that these allegations in paragraph 17 constitute the
alleged oral agreement at issue. (See Comp. ¶ 19 (“Knowing Mr. Adams was running low on funds,
and consistent with the oral contract describe above in paragraph 17 of this Complaint”); see also id.
¶ 23 (“Mr. Burton also provided Mr. Adams with money for travel expenses, as well as technical and
design advice, consistent with the contract previously reached and described above in paragraph 17
of this Complaint”).)

“[Burton’s] allegations regarding the alleged oral agreement [ar]e too vague and
indefinite to plead a breach of contract cause of action.” Canzona, 118 A.D.3d at 839.
B. At Best, Burton Has Alleged an Unenforceable Agreement to Agree
Taking Burton’s allegations as true, and resolving all reasonable inferences in his
favor, a plain reading of the complaint makes clear that the alleged oral contract, at best,
was an unenforceable “agreement to agree.” See New York Military Academy v. New
Open Group, 142 A.D. 3d 489, 490 (2d Dep’t 2016) (“‘[I]t is rightfully well settled . . . that
a mere agreement to agree, in which a material term is left for future negotiations, is
unenforceable’”) (citations omitted).
This Court need go no further than Burton’s pleading to find a prime example of
why indefinite contracts, or “agreements to agree” are unenforceable. Unable to plead
any material terms demonstrating the agreed-upon price or valuation of the purported
investment he was “denied,” Burton baselessly claims that he would have invested
$100,000 in Adams’ business and is thus entitled to at least $100 million in present-day
damages. (Compl. ¶ 33.) In other words, even though there are no factual allegations
that the parties agreed to any definite contract terms, Burton attempts to speculate into
existence an alternate reality in which he would have invested $100,000 in a company
that did not exist and had “no then-present value” but is now worth billions of dollars.
(See id. ¶¶ 28, 32, 33.)
This Court should reject Burton’s attempt at “wait and see” investing. To allow
otherwise would enable anyone to retroactively reap the benefits of a putative
investment without any of the attendant risks, merely by alleging in a lawsuit that a
FILED: KINGS COUNTY CLERK 06/03/2021 06:52 PM INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 11 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/03/2021
14 of 25
10
plaintiff was denied an opportunity to invest on his or her own preferred terms.
Moreover, Burton cannot adequately plead around the definiteness requirement
by asserting that Burton confirmed a desire to invest when “Adams found a lead
investor to set the terms and price the deal.
” (Id. ¶ 26.) The complaint nowhere alleges
that Adams agreed that Burton could invest after a lead investor was found, or that a
deal with an unknown, hypothetical lead investor would set the terms of Burton’s deal.
(See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 17, 25.) Thus, “the[] allegations are insufficient to plead the existence of
an enforceable contract for the simple reason that [Burton] fails to allege that the parties
actually agreed to look to any extrinsic event, commercial practice, or trade usage to
ascertain the price.” Gutkowski v. Steinbrenner, 680 F. Supp. 2d 602, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)
(emphasis in original).)
Nor does the complaint allege any specific facts showing how an unknown
future “lead investor” would create an objective standard or method to set the price for
Burton’s investment. See Ashkenazi v. Kelly, 157 A.D.2d 578, 579 (1st Dep’t 1990) (“there
was no objective standard or method articulated in the agreement to establish
essential terms”); Grasso v. Donnelly-Schoffstall, 2021 WL 1224052, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar.
31, 2021) (rejecting the argument that the price was sufficiently definite when it would
be set by the “price paid [for a puppy] by a third-party” because the price “to be paid by
third parties provides no definiteness to the price term . . . [and] is not an objective
method by which the Court, or any outsider, could determine how much is owed.”)
The first cause of action should be dismissed because the complaint fails to allege
the existence of an enforceable oral contract with definite terms.

C. The Complaint Fails to Allege that Defendant Breached Any Agreement
to Provide Plaintiff with an Early Investment Opportunity
Even assuming Burton has alleged the existence of an enforceable oral contract
(which he has not), Burton still fails to allege any breach. To state a claim for breach of
contract, “[t]he pleadings must be sufficiently particular to give the court and [the]
parties notice of the transactions, [or] occurrences… intended to be proved,” and must
allege “the specific provisions upon which liability is predicated.” Clifden Futures, LLC
v. Man Fin., Inc., 858 N.Y.S.2d 580, 582–83 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. Co. 2008).
“It is well-settled
that in an action to recover damages for the breach of a contract, the facts constituting
the breach must be pleaded.” Id.
Burton alleges in a conclusory fashion that Adams breached the parties’ oral
contract by “failing and refusing to grant Plaintiff the ability to invest [$100k at a $10
million valuation].” (Compl. ¶¶ 30, 33, 42.) However, Burton nowhere alleges that the
parties had reached agreement on those specific price or valuation terms. At most, the
complaint alleges that Adams “sent Mr. Burton a term sheet”, that Burton responded by
expressing his “desire and intention to invest [at some future date] when Mr. Adams
had found a lead investor to set the terms and price the deal”, and that Burton
subsequently was denied “the ability to invest when he attempted to do so” at a later
time. (Id. ¶¶ 26, 42.) In short, the complaint acknowledges that Burton was given an
early investment opportunity and rejected it. See Jericho Group, Ltd. v. Midtown Devl.,
L.P., 32 A.D.3d 294, 299 (1st Dep’t 2006) (“Rejection by counteroffer extinguishes the
offer and renders any subsequent acceptance thereof inoperative”); Thor Properties, KKC

v. Willspring Holdings, LLC, 118 A.D.3d 505, 507 (1st Dep’t 2014) (if the offeree responds
by conditioning acceptance on new or modified terms, “thereafter the offeree cannot,
[later], unilaterally revive the offer by accepting it”).
Because Burton has “failed to allege the breach of any particular contractual
provision”, this Court should dismiss the first cause of action. See Feld v. Apple Bank for
Sav., 116 A.D. 3d 549, 550 (1st Dep’t 2014).
D. Any Purported Agreement Based on Plaintiff’s Assistance in “Finding a
Lead Investor” Is Barred by the Statute of Frauds
The statute of frauds also bars Burton’s claims, which are based on allegations
that Burton assisted Adams in negotiating business opportunities with Paradigm or
other investors. Under General Obligations Law (“GOL”) section 5-701(a)(10), “a
contract to pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a . . .
‘business
opportunity’ must be made in writing.”
The New York Court of Appeals has held that “business opportunity” includes
agreements that contemplate one party’s use of his or her “‘know-how’ or ‘know-who’
,
in bringing about between principals an enterprise of some complexity or an acquisition
of a significant interest in an enterprise.” J.F. Capital Advisors, LLC v. Lightstone Group,
LLC, 25 N.Y. 3d 759, 767 (2015) (citing Freedman v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 43 N.Y. 2d 260,
267 (1977)). For example, in Goldfarb v. Shaeffer, 135 A.D.3d 505, 505 (1st Dep’t 2016), a
claim for breach of contract was dismissed because plaintiff’s allegations that he “was
responsible for introducing [defendant] to [nonparty investor],” and that his work
resulted in the underlying transaction, squarely fell within the statute of frauds. See also

“‘negotiating a business opportunity’ within the meaning of [Section] 5–701(a)(10)
includes the use of ‘connections,’ ‘ability’ and ‘knowledge’ to facilitate or assist in the
transaction by helping the acquirer of the business opportunity meet the right people
and have the right information.”)
Here, Burton, a self-proclaimed software developer, designer, and entrepreneur,
alleges that he “spent countless hours . . . with Mr. Adams helping to think through the
project and pitch to prospective investors” (Compl. ¶ 20), that “[h]e did whatever
possible to help Hayden connect with the right people to work and partner with” (id. ¶
21), and that “[a]s part of the process of helping locate a lead investor, Mr. Burton sent
Mr. Adams additional cash so he could fly to San Francisco and pitch Uniswap to
Paradigm.” (Id. ¶ 26.) These allegations, purporting to constitute Burton’s
consideration under the alleged agreement, contemplate the use of Burton’s “know
how” and “know who” and thus required any agreement to be in writing. As Burton
seeks to enforce an oral agreement, all three of his causes of action are barred. See
Snyder v. Bronfman, 13 N.Y.3d 504, 508 (2009) (Unjust enrichment and quantum meruit
are claims under “a contract implied . . . in law to pay reasonable compensation” and
thus subject to the statute of frauds).

II. The Second Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment Is Duplicative of The
Contract Claim
This Court should dismiss Burton’s second cause of action for unjust enrichment
because it is based on the same facts, and seeks the same relief, as his contract claim.
While pleading in the alternative may be permissible, Burton cannot plead around an
unenforceable agreement to agree simply by asserting a claim for unjust enrichment.
“‘An unjust enrichment claim is not available where it simply duplicates, or
replaces, a conventional contract or tort claim.’” Doller v. Prescott, 167 A.D.3d 1298, 1301
(3d Dep’t 2018) (citing Corsello v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 18 N.Y.3d 777, 790 (2012)). For
example, in Doller, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant reneged on a memorandum
of understanding to give the plaintiff the right of first refusal to purchase equity in his
company and wrongfully usurped that opportunity for himself. Id. at 1298. The
Appellate Division upheld the dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the grounds
that the memorandum of understanding was an unenforceable “agreement to agree.”
Id. at 1300. The Appellate Division then affirmed the dismissal of the unjust enrichment
claim, reasoning that the allegations were duplicative of the dismissed contract claim
and thus the claim for unjust enrichment was unavailable. Id. at 1301.
Here too, the factual allegations Burton relies on to demonstrate that Adams was
unjustly enriched are the same allegations that he uses to demonstrate he performed his
contractual obligations. The unjust enrichment claim expressly incorporates all the
prior allegations of the complaint. (Compl. ¶ 44.) It then alleges that defendant was
enriched by “Burton’s technical, financial and other assistance”, which is the exact same

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 11 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/03/2021

15
consideration that Burton relies on for the contract claim. (Compare id. ¶ 45 with ¶ 19
(“consistent with the oral contract… Burton gave Mr. Adams money to help support”);
¶ 23 (Burton provided Adams “technical and design advice consistent with the
contract”); ¶ 28 (“Burton provided [] Adams financial and personal assistance”). The
second cause of action is duplicative and insufficient.
Akerson Advertising & Marketing, Inc. v. St. John & Partners Advertising, 89 F. Supp.
3d 341, 345-46 (N.D.N.Y. 2015), is instructive. There, the plaintiff marketing firm
transferred all its assets and its lead client account to the defendant, who agreed to pay
market value for the assets and not sell the account to a third party. The plaintiff sued
for breach and unjust enrichment, alleging with respect to the unjust enrichment claim
that: (1) the defendant transferred the lead client account to a third party; (2) the value
of the account was no less than $5 million; and (3) as a result of the defendant’s unjust
enrichment, plaintiff was damaged “in no case less than $5 million.” Id. at 353. The
court dismissed the claim as duplicative of the breach of contract claim, noting that the
plaintiff sought “at least $5,000,000.00 as damages on their unjust enrichment claim,
which is the same amount they seek on their breach-of-contract claims[.]” Id. at 353-54.
The court reasoned that the plaintiff “clearly seeks the benefit of the bargain, i.e., the
value of the assets of [the] [p]laintiff which were sold”
, and concluded that a proper
unjust enrichment claim seeks to recover the value of the work performed and “does
not depend on an unenforceable promise.” Id.; see also Fallon v. McKeon, 230 A.D.2d 629,
630 (1st Dep’t 1996) (dismissing unjust enrichment claim “since instead of identifying
the reasonable value of services rendered… [the] plaintiff simply claims damages

16
identical to the other four causes of action” rendering the “claim indistinguishable from
the others“and therefore insufficient).
As in Akerson, Burton seeks identical relief both through his unjust enrichment
and breach of contract claims and does not limit the relief sought to the reasonable
value of his services. Burton expressly seeks to recover “money damages” and
“restitution” on all three claims “in an amount not less than $100 million.” (Compl.,
Prayer for Relief ¶¶ A-C.) As support for this demand, Burton asserts that “Adams’
failure and refusal to allow Mr. Burton to invest . . . translates into damages, of, at
minimum, $100 million. This amount inured to the benefit of Mr. Adams at Mr.
Burton’s expense.” (Id. ¶ 33 (emphasis added); ¶ 48 (“it would be against equity and
good conscience to allow Mr. Adams… [to] retain[] the amount Mr. Burton seeks to
recover in this lawsuit”). Burton “clearly seek[s] the benefit of the bargain” and does
not limit the relief sought to the reasonable value of his services. See Akerson, 89 F.
Supp. 3d at 353-54.
Because Burton’s unjust enrichment claim “seeks precisely the same damages”
and is “indistinguishable” from his contract claim, it “must be dismissed.” Benhan v.
eCommission Solutions, LLC, 118 A.D. 3d 605, 606-07 (1st Dep’t 2014).
III. The Third Cause of Action for Quantum Meruit Should Be Dismissed
A. The Quantum Meruit Claim Is Duplicative of the Contract Claim
As with his claim for unjust enrichment, Burton’s third cause of action for
quantum meruit should be dismissed because it is indistinguishable from the breach of
contract claim.
FILED: KINGS COUNTY CLERK 06/03/2021 06:52 PM INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 11 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/03/2021

Under New York law, claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment are
analyzed as a single quasi-contract claim. Mid-Hudson Catskill Rural Migrant Ministry,
Inc. v. Fine Host Corp., 418 F.3d 168, 175 (2d Cir. 2005) (“‘quantum meruit and unjust
enrichment are not separate causes of action,’ and [] ‘unjust enrichment is a required
element for an implied-in-law, or quasi contract, and quantum meruit . . . is one
measure of liability for the breach of such a contract.’”) (citing Seiden Assocs., Inc. v. ANC
Holdings, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 89, 96 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (rev’d on other grounds).)
Like unjust enrichment, quantum meruit is an equitable remedy. It is not a
backdoor to enforce an otherwise invalid contract. See Martin H. Bauman Assoc., Inc. v.
H & M Intern. Transport, Inc., 171 A.D.2d 479, 484 (1st Dep’t 1991) (dismissing quantum
meruit claim and noting “quantum meruit is intended to avoid a party’s unjust
enrichment; it is certainly not a device wherein a plaintiff may enforce a purported
agreement which might ultimately be found not to be viable.”) To that end, a cause of
action for quantum meruit is not stated when it requests that the court enforce the
benefit of the bargain rather than “recovery for the value of the services []rendered.”
Toll v. Tannebaum, 982 F. Supp. 2d 541, 559 (E.D. Penn. 2013) (applying New York state
law) (dismissing claim when “Complaint does not seek recovery for the value of the
services he rendered . . . [but] [r]ather, he asks the Court to order payment “that he
would have contracted for.”).
Burton’s quantum meruit claim is based on the same factual allegations and
seeks the same relief as his contract claim. In support of the third cause of action, the
complaint expressly alleges that Burton “performed the services described in this
FILED: KINGS COUNTY CLERK 06/03/2021 06:52 PM INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 11 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/03/2021

18
Complaint” and it asserts that the reasonable value of the purported services rendered
can be “readily calculated and is equal to, at a minimum, $100 million, the value of the
investment which Mr. Burton was not allowed to make.” (Compl. ¶¶ 50, 53 (emphasis
added).) This is a serious problem. Burton is not seeking to recover the reasonable
value of his purported services, but rather is attempting to use the equitable theory of
quantum meruit as a backdoor to enforce an unenforceable agreement to agree. The
quantum meruit claim is therefore not properly stated and should be dismissed.
B. Burton Fails to Allege the Reasonable Value of Any Services that He
Provided
The cause of action for quantum meruit also fails because other than money, the
complaint does not sufficiently allege what “services” he provided or the reasonable
value of those services.
“To state a claim in quantum meruit, a plaintiff must allege its good faith
performance of services, the defendant’s acceptance of those services, an expectation of
compensation for the services, and the reasonable value of those services.” Skillgames,
LLC v. Brody, 1 A.D.3d 247, 251 (1st Dep’t 2003). To support such a claim, a plaintiff
must allege that it actually performed services for defendant not “only that it provided
him with money.” Id.; see also id. (affirming dismissal of quantum meruit claim and
stating that the claim does not apply “to the provision of money rather than services”).
Here, the complaint alleges that Burton “gave Mr. Adams money” (Compl. ¶ 19),
“paid Mr. Adams $10,000” (id. ¶ 22), “provided Mr. Adams with money for travel
expenses” (id. ¶ 23), and “sent [Adams] $15,000 to help him cover rent and costs.” (Id. ¶
FILED: KINGS COUNTY CLERK 06/03/2021 06:52 PM INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 11 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/03/2021
23 of 25
19
24.) These allegations that Burton provided Adams with money rather than “services”
cannot support a quantum meruit cause of action. See Skillgames, 1 A.D.3d at 251.
Moreover, the complaint fails to plead any facts that Burton in fact provided any
services to Adams, let alone the reasonable value of such services. At most, Burton
includes a passing allegation that he provided “technical and design advice” to Adams,
but such vague allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See DeSilva v. North Shore-
Long Island Jewish Health System, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 2d 497, 535 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (“because
plaintiffs have set forth no more than vague and conclusory allegations regarding what
services they provided to defendants or what the reasonable value for these services
was, they have failed to state a claim for quantum meruit.”). Burton’s quantum meruit
claim must fail.
IV. This Court Should Dismiss the Complaint with Prejudice
Although leave to amend is freely granted, it is permissible to dismiss a claim
with prejudice where it would be futile to permit amendment. See Carroll ex rel Pfizer,
Inc. v. McKinnell, 19 Misc. 3d 1106(A), 859 N.Y.S.2d 901 (Sup. Ct. 2008) (“it is well-settled
that a complaint should be dismissed with prejudice where the plaintiff is unable to
adequately allege facts sufficient to support his or her claim.
”)
Burton’s alleged oral agreement is hopelessly indefinite. He has not and cannot
allege the material terms necessary to prove an enforceable contract, and if Burton had
the facts to do so, he would have. Further, his causes of action for unjust enrichment
and quantum meruit are duplicative of the invalid contract. For these reasons
dismissing the complaint with prejudice is more than justified.

CONCLUSION
Burton never thought to memorialize any alleged agreement in writing since
there was no enforceable contract for Adams to provide anything, and he even rejected
a term sheet when provided one. Burton is now simply seeking an undeserved
windfall. His claim for breach of contract, and his duplicative claims for unjust
enrichment and quantum meruit should all be dismissed with prejudice.

[TO BE FILLED]
Introduction
Richard Burton provided Hayden Adams the money and assistance he needed to build his massively successful Uniswap Protocol and the business behind it.  In exchange, Mr. Adams promised Mr. Burton that he would allow Mr. Burton to be an early investor in Uniswap.  The clear terms of this agreement are pleaded in the Complaint.  When the time came for Mr. Burton to invest, however, Mr. Adams reneged.   Instead, Mr. Adams kept for himself the money and the value of the assistance that Mr. Burton had provided.  Mr. Adams was bound by law and equity to abide by the promise he had made to Mr. Burton.  Mr. Adams refused to honor that promise, leaving Mr. Burton no recourse but this action. 
Mr. Adams now moves to dismiss the Complaint.  Fundamentally, Mr. Adams ignores the facts alleged in the Complaint, which state with specificity the services provided by Mr. Burton to Mr. Adams, and the reasonable value of those services.  Additionally, contrary to Mr. Adams’ contentions, the Complaint adequately pleads the key terms of the parties’ agreement.  Moreover, the allegations of the Complaint, and the agreement between Mr. Burton and Mr. Adams, do not run afoul of the statute of frauds.  Finally, Mr. Adams’ motion fails to grasp that Mr. Burton’s equitable relief is pleaded in the alternative because quasi-contract claims can only duplicate a contract claim where there is a contract claim from which a remedy may be had, and Mr. Adams argues there is none here.  If the parties’ contract is not legally enforceable, then qausi-contract claims exist to fill the vacuum and provide Mr. Burton a remedy for Mr. Adams’ unjust receipt of value for which he gave nothing to Mr. Burton.  Mr. Adams’ motion has no merit.  
As set forth below, the parties’ agreement is legally enforceable, and Mr. Burton’s breach of contract claim is adequately pleaded under the law.  In the alternative, if the Court finds the parties’ agreement unenforceable, Mr. Burton’s quasi-contract claims remain viable.  For these reasons, and as set forth below, Mr. Adams’ motion to dismiss should be denied.
Factual Background
This case involves Defendant Mr. Adams’ breach of an oral contract between him and Mr. Burton (the “Contract”).  Rather than including a full recitation of the facts, which are fully set forth in the Complaint and incorporated herein, Mr. Burton seeks to clarify certain discrete issues that Mr. Adams mischaracterizes or ignores in his motion to dismiss (the “Motion”). 
First, to support an argument that the Statute of Frauds bars the contract claims in this lawsuit, Mr. Adams suggests that the consideration Mr. Burton provided to Mr. Adams included “the use of Burton’s ‘know how’ and ‘know who’” to facilitate investments in Uniswap. See Motion at p. 13.  To support his arguments, Mr. Adams points to the allegation in Paragraph 21 of the Complaint that Mr. Burton “did whatever was possible to help Hayden connect with the right people to work and partner with.”  Motion at 13.  Thus, the argument is a mischaracterization of the allegations in the Complaint.  In reality, the Complaint does not say that Mr. Burton made introductions, drew on his connections, attended any presentation to investors, or otherwise “facilitate[d] or assist[ed] in [a] transaction by helping the acquirer of the business opportunity to meet the right people and have the right information.”  See Motion at 13.  
The Complaint does allege that Mr. Burton “help[ed] [Mr. Adams] think through the project and pitch” (Complaint ¶ 20) and provided him “technical and design advice” (id. ¶ 23).  The allegation that Mr. Burton “did whatever was possible to help Hayden connect with the right people to work and partner with” (id. ¶ 21) is meant in the most literal sense: Mr. Burton “paid Mr. Adams $10,000” (id. ¶ 22); “provided Mr. Adams with money for travel expenses” (Id. ¶ 23); “sent [Mr. Adams] $15,000” (id. ¶ 24); and “sent Mr. Adams additional cash so he could fly to San Francisco and pitch Uniswap to Paradigm” (id. ¶ 26).  None of these allegations contemplates the use of Mr. Burton’s “know how” or “know who” to facilitate investments.  They expressly allege that Mr. Burton provided financial support and resources in exchange for Mr. Adams’ promise to provide Mr. Burton an early investment opportunity in return.
Second, Mr. Adams argues that “the complaint acknowledges that Burton was given an early investment opportunity [in the form of the term sheet Mr. Adams provided to Mr. Burton] and rejected it.”  Motion at 11.  But nothing in the Complaint suggests that Mr. Burton ever rejected Mr. Adams’ early investment offer.  On the contrary, the Complaint alleges that “Mr. Adams sent Mr. Burton a term sheet and Mr. Burton confirmed the desire to and intention to invest.”  Complaint ¶ 26.  Further, “Mr. Adams initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation for $100,000.  When Mr. Burton attempted to accept that offer to invest, he was told that he could not.”  Id. ¶ 30.  Mr. Burton neither rejected Mr. Adams’ offer nor made a counteroffer.  He accepted the offer, performed his obligations, and Mr. Adams breached the Contract. 
Argument
Legal Standards
A defendant seeking dismissal under CPLR 3211(a)(7) “bear[s] the burden of establishing that the complaint fails to state a viable cause of action.”  Connolly v. Long Island Power Auth., 30 N.Y.3d 719, 728 (2018).  On a motion to dismiss, the Court is tasked with determining only whether the facts as alleged fit within “any cognizable legal theory.”  Leon v. Martinez, 84 N.Y.2d 83, 88 (1994) (emphasis added).  “[T]he criterion is whether the proponent of the pleading has a cause of action, not whether he has stated one.”  Leon, 84 N.Y.2d at 88 (quotation and citation omitted).  Indeed, “[t]he test of the sufficiency of a pleading is ‘whether it gives sufficient notice of the transaction, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences intended to be proved and whether the requisite elements of any cause of action known to our law can be discerned from its averments.’”  Hampshire Properties v. BTA Bldg. & Developing, Inc., 122 A.D.3d 573, 573 (2d Dep’t 2014) (citations omitted).  In making this determination, the Court must construe the pleadings liberally, accepting the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, and according the plaintiff “the benefit of every possible favorable inference.”  Leon, 84 N.Y.2d at 87; Jannetti v. Whelan, 97 A.D.3d 797, 797 (2d Dep’t 2012).  
The Claim for Breach of Contract Is Based on Well-Pleaded Allegations That the Parties Had an Oral Contract Which Mr. Adams Breached; Thus, Dismissal Is Not Warranted.
A viable claim for breach of contract must allege: (1) the existence of an oral contract; (2) the plaintiff's performance under the contract; (3) the defendant's breach of that contract; and (4) resulting damages.  See Zentz v. Int'l Foreign Exch. Concepts, L.P., 33 Misc. 3d 1212(A), 939 N.Y.S.2d 745 (Sup. Ct. 2011), aff'd, 106 A.D.3d 904, 965 N.Y.S.2d 180 (2013) (citing JP Morgan Chase v. J.H. Elec. of New York, Inc., 69 A.D.3d 802, 803 (2d Dep’t 2010)).  The Complaint pleads each of these elements.  The Contract existed between Mr. Burton and Mr. Adams.  (Complaint at ¶¶ 17, 19, 37-39).  Mr. Burton performed his obligations under that Contract.  (Complaint at ¶¶ 19-24, 41).  Mr. Adams did not perform, thereby breaching the Contract.  (Complaint at ¶¶ 30-31, 42).  And as a result of Mr. Adams breach of the Contract, Mr. Burton suffered damages.  (Complaint at ¶¶ 33, 43).  
The Complaint Pleads the Existence of An Enforceable Oral Contract. 
The Motion incorrectly argues that Mr. Burton’s breach of contract claim is not “sufficiently certain and specific to ascertain the parties’ intentions and the terms of the agreement.” Motion at 6 (citing Balco Dev. Corp. v. Peters, 276 A.D.2d 729, 729 (2d Dep’t 2000).  But far from “trap[ing] [Mr. Adams] into surprise contractual obligations” (see Motion at 7)—and the Motion does not argue that Mr. Adams has been surprised—the Complaint specifically alleges both the parties’ intentions and the terms of their oral contract.  
In support for the proposition that the breach of contract claim is insufficiently pleaded, the Motion cites Brembo, S.P.A. v. T.A.W. Performance LLC, 176 A.D.3d 535, 536 (1st Dep’t 2019), in which the court found that “[n]o terms were agreed upon when the plaintiff allegedly made the promise: not the duration of the agreement, not the pricing of [the] plaintiff’s parts, and not any other term governing the alleged [agreement].” Motion at 7-8 (citing Brembo, 176 A.D.3d at 536).   The Motion also cites Kunica v. St. Jean Financial, Inc., in which the court found that “the oral agreement is silent with respect to the amount of stock options … to be awarded, the exercise price of the stock options or the date on which [plaintiff] could exercise the options.” No. 97 Civ. 3804(RWS), 1998 WL 437153, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1998).  See Motion at 8.  But these cases are inapposite.  There, the respective courts found that the material terms of the contracts at issue had not been pleaded; on the contrary, here Mr. Burton has pleaded the material terms of the parties’ agreement.  
The Complaint specifically pleads the kinds of support that Mr. Burton provided to Mr. Adams in the form of advice and money.  See Complaint ¶¶ 17-24.  Mr. Burton has pleaded that Mr. Adams assured him an early investment opportunity “in exchange for his support.” Id. ¶ 26.  And the Complaint alleges the particulars of that investment opportunity based on the term sheet that Mr. Adams gave Mr. Burton:  Mr. Burton would be permitted “to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation for $100,000” (id. ¶ 30) “when Mr. Adams had found a lead investor” (id. ¶ 26).  This condition precedent was satisfied when Mr. Adams found Paradigm as a lead investor and Paradigm invested in Uniswap with $1 million in seed funding at a $10 million valuation.  See id. ¶ 32.  These allegations represent the material terms of the parties’ agreement and must be taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss.  See Leon, 84 N.Y.2d at 87.  
Mr. Adams next argues that the parties’ agreement represents an unenforceable “agreement to agree,” and did not contain an objective method for setting a price.  See Motion at 9-10.  While it is true that the parties agreed that Mr. Burton would invest “when Mr. Adams had found a lead investor to set the terms and price the deal” (Complaint ¶ 26), Mr. Adams ignores the allegation in the Complaint that the parties actually agreed on a price:  “Specifically, Mr. Adams initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation.  When Mr. Burton attempted to accept that offer to invest, he was told that he could not.”  Id. ¶ 30 (emphasis added).  In each of the cases cited by Mr. Adams in support of his argument, the parties disagreed about the price of the transactions at issue and the methods of setting terms.  See Motion at 10 (citing Gutkowski v. Steinbrenner, 680 F. Supp. 2d 602, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Ashkenazi v. Kelly, 157 A.D.2d 578, 579 (1st Dep’t 1990); Grasso v. Donnelly-Schoffstall, No. 1:20-CV-521 (LEK/DJS), 2021 WL 1224052, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2021)).  That is not the case here, where the parties actually agreed on a price and terms, and those terms are pleaded in the Complaint.  As such, the oral contract pleaded in the Complaint is not an unenforceable agreement to agree.  It is an agreement, period.
Finally, Mr. Adams argues that the parties’ agreement is unenforceable because, Under General Obligations Law (“GOL”) section 5-701(a)(10), “a contract to pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a …  ‘business opportunity’ must be made in writing.”  Motion at 12.  In support of this argument, Mr. Adams cites cases in which plaintiffs drew on their connections and contacts and made introductions and presentations to potential investors. See Motion at 12-13 (citing Goldfarb v. Schaeffer, 135 A.D.3d 505, 505 (1st Dep’t 2016); Zeising v. Kelly, 152 F. Supp. 2d 335, 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  The Complaint alleges no such activities by Mr. Burton. 
The Complaint does not allege that Mr. Burton made introductions, drew on his connections, attended any presentation to investors, or otherwise “facilitate[d] or assist[ed] in [a] transaction by helping the acquirer of the business opportunity to meet the right people and have the right information.” See Motion at 13. (citing Zeising v. Kelly, 152 F. Supp. 2d 335, 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  It does allege that Mr. Burton “help[ed] [Mr. Adams] think through the project and pitch” (Complaint ¶ 20) and provided him “technical and design advice” (id. ¶ 23).  Mr. Burton “did whatever was possible to help Hayden connect with the right people to work and partner with” (id. ¶ 21) in a financial sense:  Mr. Burton “paid Mr. Adams $10,000” (id. ¶ 22); “provided Mr. Adams with money for travel expenses” (id. ¶ 23); “sent [Mr. Adams] $15,000” (id. ¶ 24); and “sent Mr. Adams additional cash so he could fly to San Francisco and pitch Uniswap to Paradigm” (id. ¶ 26).  
Unlike the services provided in Goldfarb and Zeising, the services Mr. Burton alleges he provided to Mr. Adams were limited to assisting him to develop the Uniswap software itself, not making introductions or presentations.  To the extent that Mr. Burton enabled Mr. Adams to make presentations, pitches, or introductions, it was through the use of Mr. Burton’s dollars, not his “know how” or “know who.”  Courts have not found that technical support and financial facilitation fall within the ambit of Section 5-701(a)(10).  See Dorfman v. Reffkin, 144 A.D.3d 10, 16 (2016) (holding that services “including developing materials to secure investor backing, recruiting engineers and others to [the company], and developing the details of how [the company’s] software product, web, and mobile applications would be ‘architected’” did not fall within Section 5-701(a)(10)”).   As such, the parties’ agreement is enforceable, and Mr. Burton’s claim is not barred by the statute of frauds. 
The Complaint Pleads That Mr. Adams Breached the Contract. 
The Motion also argues that Mr. Burton has not pleaded that Mr. Adams breached the Contract.  Mr. Adams argues that “Burton nowhere alleges that the parties had reached agreement on those specific price or valuation terms,” (Motion at 11) i.e., that Mr. Burton would invest $100,000 at a $10 million valuation.  Again, Mr. Adams ignores the Complaint’s allegations.  Paragraph 30 of the Complaint states that “Mr. Adams initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation.  When Mr. Burton attempted to accept that offer to invest, he was told that he could not.”  Id. ¶ 30 (emphasis added).  
Next, in characterizing the allegation in Paragraph 26 of the Complaint that “Mr. Burton confirmed the desire and intention to invest when Mr. Adams had found a lead investor to set the terms and price the deal,” Mr. Adams reaches the non sequitur that “the complaint acknowledges that Burton was given an early investment opportunity and rejected it.” Motion at 11.  The Complaint does not allege that Mr. Burton rejected an early investment offer from Mr. Adams, or that Mr. Burton made a counteroffer.  Rather, it alleges that “Mr. Adams initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation [i.e., offer].  When Mr. Burton attempted to accept that offer to invest [i.e., acceptance], he was told that he could not [i.e., breach].”  Complaint ¶ 30 (emphasis added).)  Paragraph 30 of the Complaint manifestly demonstrates that Mr. Adams breached the Contract—namely, he refused to allow Mr. Burton to make an early investment on the terms to which the parties agreed.  To argue that this paragraph does not plead a breach of the agreement strains credulity. 
The Complaint pleads the existence of an enforceable oral contract.  It pleads that Mr. Burton upheld his end of the bargain, and that Mr. Adams did not.  And it pleads that Mr. Burton was damaged by this breach.  For these reasons, the motion to dismiss should be denied.  
Mr. Adams’ Motion to Dismiss the Quasi-Contract Claims Should Be Denied Because They Are Properly Pleaded in The Alternative.
Mr. Adams further contends that the Complaint’s quasi-contract claims (Counts II and III) should be dismissed because they rely on the same allegations as Mr. Burton’s contract claim.  See Motion at 14-18.  These quasi-contract claims are pleaded in the alternative: if Mr. Burton cannot recover on his contract claim, he should be able to recover on the contract claims because it would be unjust for Mr. Adams to retain the benefits that Mr. Burton afforded him at Mr. Burton’s expense.  By definition, then, the quasi-contract claims cannot be “duplicative” of the contract claim because recovery on Count I would render recovery on Counts II and III superfluous.  “[S]ince plaintiff is entitled to plead inconsistent causes of action in the alternative, the quasi-contractual claims are not precluded by the pleading of a cause of action for breach of an oral agreement.”  Winick Realty Grp. LLC v. Austin & Assocs., 51 A.D.3d 408, 408, 857 N.Y.S.2d 114, 115 (2008).  Mr. Adams has called into question the existence of the contract between him and Mr. Burton, and “where there is a bona fide dispute as to the existence of a contract or the application of a contract in the dispute in issue, a plaintiff may proceed upon a theory of quasi contract as well as breach of contract, and will not be required to elect his or her remedies.”  Zentz, 33 Misc 3d at *5.  
Mr. Burton’s Quantum Meruit Claim Is Sufficiently Pleaded. 
Finally, Mr. Adams claims that Mr. Burton’s quantum meruit claim should be dismissed because the Complaint alleges neither the services that Mr. Burton provided nor the value of such services.  Motion at 19-20.  The first part of this argument ignores the specific allegations that “Mr. Burton spent countless hours in front of a whiteboard with Mr. Adams helping to think through the project and pitch” (Complaint ¶ 4) and that Mr. Burton provided “technical and design advice” (id. ¶ 23).  The specificity of these allegations distinguishes them from the “vague and conclusory” allegations of DeSilva v. North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 2d 497, 535 (E.D.N.Y. 2011), on which the Motion relies.  In contrast, the Complaint identifies with specificity the services that Mr. Burton performed, thereby sufficiently pleading a cause of action for quantum meruit.  
Further, Mr. Burton has pleaded with specificity the reasonable value of his services.  In Paragraph 34 of the Complaint, it is alleged that “[b]ut for Mr. Burton’s belief that he would be allowed to invest in and benefit from his support of Mr. Adams and the Uniswap project, Mr. Burton would not have provided the measure of assistance that was offered and accepted by Mr. Adams.”  Mr. Burton is not a consultant and does not ordinarily provide services like those he provided to Mr. Adams.  For his services, the reasonable value is an opportunity, not dollars.  The type of opportunity that represents the reasonable value of Mr. Burton’s services is the early investment opportunity that is described in the Complaint—that is, investing $100,000 in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation. See Complaint ¶ 30.  That value, as a damages figure representing the lost opportunity, is $100 million.  Id. ¶ 53.
“The elements of a cause of action sounding in quantum meruit are (1) performance of services in good faith, (2) acceptance of services by the person to whom they are rendered, (3) expectation of compensation therefor, and (4) reasonable value of the services rendered.”  Evans-Freke v. Showcase Contr. Corp., 85 A.D.3d 961, 962 (2d Dep’t 2011).  Mr. Burton had pleaded each of these elements.  The Complaint identifies that he provided services in good faith (Complaint ¶ 20), that Mr. Adams accepted those services (id. ¶ 34), that Mr. Burton expected top be compensated for those services (id.), and the value of those services (id. ¶ 33).  
Because Mr. Burton has pleaded the specific services he provided to Mr. Adams and the reasonable value of those services, his quantum meruit claim is adequately pleaded and should not be dismissed. 
Even If Mr. Burton’s Claims Were Not Sufficiently Pleaded, Which They Are, Available Documents Warrant Leave to Replead.
Although Mr. Burton maintains that he has pleaded his claims with sufficient detail, should the Court determine otherwise, Mr. Burton requests that he be provided the opportunity to replead to incorporate the term sheet and written communications identified in Paragraph 26 of the Complaint, which demonstrate the parties’ understanding of their agreement.  
Leave to amend pleadings pursuant to CPLR 3025(b) “‘shall be freely given’ absent prejudice or surprise.”  McCaskey, Davies and Assoc., Inc. v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 59 N.Y.2d 755, 757 (1983) (citations omitted); Raney v. Seldon Stokoe & Sons, Inc., 42 A.D.3d 617, 620 (3d Dep’t 2007) (because defendants did not allege surprise or prejudice, granting plaintiff leave to amend complaint was warranted); Nyahsa Services, Inc., Self-Ins. Tr. V. People Care Inc., 156 A.D.3d 99, 102 (3d Dep’t 2017) (joining the First, Second, and Fourth Departments in declining to require an evidentiary showing of merit on a motion to amend pleadings) (quotation and citations omitted).
Here, leave to amend is warranted in the event that the Court decides that the parties’ Contract has not been alleged “in detail” because material available both to Mr. Burton and Mr. Adams will confirm the particulars of the parties’ agreement.  
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Hayden Adams’ motion to dismiss should be denied in its entirety.

Plaintiff RICHARD BURTON commenced this action against Defendant HAYDEN

enrichment sounding in quantum meruit in connection with Plaintiffs role in developing

B. Factual Background

Since the Court is bound to accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true (Leon v
Martinez, 84 NYS2d 83, 87, 614 NYS2d 972 [1994]), Plaintiff Burton is a software developer,
designer and entrepreneur, and the founder of “Balance,” an Ethereum blockchain wallet startup.
Defendant Adams is founder and CEO of “Uniswap,” a DEX software that improves the
functionality of trading on the Ethereum platform. While Uniswap bills itself as the largest DEX
on Ethereum, when the parties met in 2018, Uniswap was “little more than an idea.”

Burton allowed Adams to Work on Uniswap daily in Balance’s offices, spending “countless
hours in front of a whiteboard,” helping Adams think through the project and pitch the project to
prospective investors, all in the hopes of financially benefitting. In addition to technical and design

advice, Burton, knowing Adams was running low on funds, also supplied him $25,000 for software

development, rent, and other costs.

NYSCEF DOC, NO, 24 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

Burton alleges that, “[a]s consideration for [Burton’s] assistance,” they agreed he would
have the ability to be an early investor in Uniswap, and that, <pjut for” such agreement, Burton
would not have provided the support that he offered to, and that was accepted by, Adams. It is
undisputed that, at some point thereafter, Adams offered Burton a deal “a term sheet,” and that
Burton confirmed his continued interest in investing, indicating he would only do so after Adams
had found a “lead investor to set the terms and price the deal.” Burton thereafter financed Adams’s
flight to San Francisco to “pitch Uniswap to Paradigm, a well-known blockchain focused venture
i
capital firm.” Paradigm went on to seed $1 million into Adams’s then still-unincorporated

enterprise, now Universal, at a $10 million valuation.

The Complaint alleges that, since then, and as a product of Burton’s assistance, Uniswap

has seen a major increase in trading, processing over $110 billion in volume, and “increasing to

the tune of more than $1 billion daily.”

C. Arguments

Burton argues the foregoing facts set forth a prima facie case that the parties entered an
oral “contract,” whereby he would be given the opportunity to invest in Uniswap once it took a
“concrete” form into which an investment could be made, and that this contract is supported by
Adams’s assurances provided “in writing, in person and on voice-calls.” Burton commenced the
instant action after Adams rejected his post-Paradigm $100,000 investment proffer, alleging
breach of contract, or alternatively, unjust enrichment. Burton argues that $100 million is the

reasonable value of his $25,000 cash and critical developmental support, enabling Adams to be

enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 RECELVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

Adams disputes Burton’s characterizations and seeks to limit Burtons claim sounding in
quantum meruit to $25,000 in addition to something akin to an hourly breakdown of the
“reasonable value” of Burton’s services.

| Discussion
A. Contract Claim

The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) formation of a contract
between plaintiff and defendant, 2) performance by plaintiff, (3) defendant's failure to perform,
(4) resulting damage (Riccio v Genworth Fin., 184 AD3d 590, 124 NYS3d 370 [2d Dept 2020]).
The requirements for the formation of a contract are (1) at least two parties with legal capacity to
contract, (2) mutual assent to the terms of the contract, and (3) consideration (Restatement
[Second] of Contracts §§ 9, 12, 23). The first step in considering whether a contract was formed
is to determine if there was a sufficiently definite offer such that its unequivocal acceptance would
have given rise to an enforceable contract (Kolchins v Evolution Mkts., Inc., 31 NY3d 100, 73
NYS3d 519 [2018]). This determination must be made looking to the objective manifestations of
the parties’ intents (Utica Builders, LLC v Collins, 176 AD3d 897, 899, 110 NYS3d 49, 51-52 [2d
Dept 2019}), bearing in mind that assent may take the form of written or spoken words (express
contract) or conduct manifesting hgreement (contract implied-in-fact) (Miller v Schloss, 218 NY
400, 113 NE 337 [1916]).* |

As a general rule, if an acceptance is qualified with conditions, it is treated as a rejection

and counteroffer (Roer v Cross Coty. Med. Ctr. Corp., 83 AD2d 861, 441 NYS2d 844 [2d Dept

1981]). Specifically, where material terms are left for future negotiations, courts consider it merely

4 A binding contract may also be formed by the oral acceptance of a written contract (Mor v Fastow, 32
AD3d 419, 819 NYS2d 560 [2d Dept 2006]; Morton 's of Chicago/Great Neck LLC v Crab House, Inc.,
297 AD2d 335, 746 NYS2d 317 [2d Dept 2002]).

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 i RECEIVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

i

an agreement to agree and, therefore, unenforceable (4/0 BPR Corp. v Chmelecki Asset Mgmt.,
Inc., 51 AD3d 715, 859 NYS2d 209 [2d Dept 2008]). This is true when an agreement contains
open terms, calls for future approval, and expressly anticipates future preparation and execution
of contract documents (Carmon v Soleh Boneh Ltd., 206 AD2d 450, 450, 614 NYS2d 555, 556
[2d Dept 1994]). There, courts operate with a strong presumption against finding a binding and

enforceable obligation (id).

Here, Plaintiff alleges that the parties agreed that he would be given the opportunity to
invest in Uniswap, if, when, or once Uniswap “took a concrete form into which investment could
be made.” Accordingly, any purported “agreement” was unenforceable because it was qualified
with conditions, devoid of material terms, expressly anticipating future approval, preparation, and

i
execution of contract documents. The Court, therefore, finds that the parties do not have a binding
and enforceable contract. |

To the extent that Plaintiff maintains that agreement was supported by Defendant’s

t

assurances provided “in writing, in person and on voice-calls,” New York’s “Statute of Frauds,

i

codified in General Obligations Law Sections 5-701 and 5-703, provides, with many exceptions,

that certain agreements, promises, or undertakings are void unless in writing. Most relevant here,

section 5-701(a) applies the Statute of Frauds to “a contract to pay compensation for services

rendered in negotiating a . . . business opportunity, business, i . .or-an. interest therein... .”5

Accordingly, such writings are material. Here, however, the only writings referenced are. the

|

> Inacommercial context, courts sometime look at partial performance as an indicia of an agreement even
without writing, and indeed, New York’s Commercial Code, dealing with transactions between
merchants, has a specific section addressing the practical business reality of transactions between a
buyer and a seller (see § 2-201). Plaintiff has not suggested, however, that the underlying transaction
was between commercial entities. ;

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 RECELVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

foregoing term sheet and emails, which, for the reasons previously stated, do not suggest the
existence of a contract.
B. Duplicative Claim
Contrary to Defendant’s allegations, it is well established that quasi contract and breach of
contract claims may be pleaded jointly and that a party is not precluded from proceeding on both
breach of contract and quasi-contractual theories where there is a bona fide dispute as to the
existence of a contract (see Polley v Plainshun Corp., 8 AD2d 638, 186 NYS2d 295 [2d Dept
1959]; Krigsfeld v Feldman, 115 AD3d 712, 982 NYS2d 487 [2d Dept 2014]; AHA Sales, Inc. v
Creative Bath Products, Inc., 58 AD3d 6, 867 NYS2d 169 [2d Dept 2008]). The action is
predicated on an obligation the law creates precisely in the absence of an agreement (Pappas v
Tzolis, 20 NY3d 228, 958 nvs2d 656 [2012]; Goldman v Metro. Life Ins. Co., 5 NY3d 561, 807
NYS2d 583 [2005]; Georgia Malone & Co., Inc. v Rieder, 19 NY3d 511, 950 NYS2d 333 [2012]).
C. Quantum Meruit |
In order to make out a claim in quantum meruit, a plaintiff must establish (1) the
performance of the services in good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person to whom
they are rendered, (3) an expectation of compensation, and (4) the reasonable value of the services
(Miranco Contracting, Inc. v Perel, 57 AD3d 956, 871 NYS2d 310 [2d Dept 2008]; Tesser v
Allboro Equip. Co., 302 AD2d 589, 590, 756 NYS2d 253, 254 [2d Dept 2003]; Geraldi v Melamid,
212 AD2d 575, 622 NYS2d 742 [2d Dept 1995]).
Here, the pleadings are clearly sufficient to establish three of the four foregoing elements of
quantum meruit for purposes of defeating the motion, i.e., (1) the performance of the services in

good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person to whom they are rendered, and (3) an

expectation of compensation. What remains less clear is the proper standard for calculating the

“reasonable value of the services” within the context of a quantum meruit claim, and, specifically,
when and whether “other factors,” such as the amount of a defendant's enrichment should be
considered where, as here, there is no claim of misconduct, malfeasance, or statutory violation. In
the interest of justice, both sides should be afforded an opportunity to brief this Court on that issue.

Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to dismiss (Seq. No. 1) is granted solely to the extent of
granting both sides until January 16, 2022 to submit one further affirmation or memorandum of
law, narrowly focusing on arguments as to the proper standard of calculating the “reasonable value
of the services” with respect to a quantum meruit claim where no claim of misconduct,

malfeasance, or violation of a statue has been made.

purposes of the CPLR § 3211 dismissal motion (/F Capital Advisors, LLC v Lightstone:Group,
LLC, 25 NY3d.759, 762, 16 NYS3d 222 citing Leon v.Martinez, 84 NYS2d 83, 87,614 NYS2d

space. within Balance’s offices to support Adams in creating Uniswap, including: “technical and

As consideration for Burton’s assistance, the parties corally agreed that Burtom would be
given the.option.to be an early investor-in Uniswap, and, but for that oral agreement, Burton would
not have provided the support that Adams relied upon:

At some point, Adams offered Burton a deal “term sheel,” however, while Burton
confirméd his continued interest in investing, he indicated he would now only do-so after Adams
had found a “lead investor to set'the terms aiid price the deal.” Burton thereafter financed Adams’s

Analvsis
A. Contract Claim

As noted in the Jnterim Decision, the basic requirements for contract:formation are (1) at
least two parties with legal capacity te contract, (2) mutual assent to. the terms ofthe contract, and
(3) consideration (Restatement [Second] of Contracts §§ 9, 12,23). The basic elements of a breach.
of contract cause of action are (1) formation of a contract between plaintiff and defendant, (2)
performance by plaintiff, (3).defendant’s failure to perform, (4) resulting damage (Riccio p
Genworth Fin., 184 AD3d 590,.124:NYS3d.370 [2d Dept 20201).

In analyzing the first step, the parties’ legal capacity to contract, this Court accepted the
Burton’s statement that the parties reached an “oral agteement,” bearing in mind that assent to
such an agreement may: také. the forin of written or spoken words (express contract) or conduct:
manifesting agreement (contract implied-in-fact) (Miller v Schloss, 218 NY 400, 113 NE 337
[1916]). Thus, an oral agreement can be enforceable as long as the terms are cleat and definite
and the conduct of the parties evinces mutual assent "sufficiently definite to assure that the parties
are truly in agreement with respect.to all material terms" (Matter of Express Indus. & Term, Corp.
‘y New York State Dept. of Transp., 93 NY2d 584, 589 [1999]), A contract also may be implied
where inferences can be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case and the intention ‘of
the parties as indicated by their conduct. However, not all terms of a contract need be fixed with
absolute. certainty. Thus, the.doctrine of indefinitenese should not be used to "defeat the reasonable
expectations of the parties in entering into the contract" (Cobble Hill Nursing Home v Henry &
Warren Corp., 74 NY¥2d 475, 483 [1989], cert denied 498 US 816 [1990]). Where "there may exist.
an objective method for supplying the missing terms heeded to calculate the alleged compensation

owed plaintiff,"-an oral agreement is not; as’a matter of law, unenforceable for indefiniteness (see,

INDEX NO. 506967/2021
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 37 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 05/20/2022

e.g. Basu v Alphaber Mgt. LEC, 127 AD3d 450, 450 [ist. Dept 2015]; Abrams Realty Corp. v
Ele, 279 AD2d 261 [Ist Dept 2001], fy denied 96 N.Y.2d 745 [2001)).

The /nferim Decision noted, however, that when, as here; acceptance. is expressly qualified
with conditions, it is generally treated as either a rejection and counteroffer or an agreement to
agree. (Roer v Cross Catv. Méd. Ctr. Corp., 83 AD2d 861, 441 NYS2d 844 [2d Dept 1981]; 470.
BPR Carp. v Chmelecki Asset Mem, ine., 51 AD3d7 15, 859 NYS2d 209 [2d Dept 2008): Carmon
v Soleh Boneh Ltd., 206 AD2d 450, 450, 614 NYS2d 555, 556 [2d Dept 1994]). Thus, this Court.
concluded that, even if the parties initially reached what could have been an enforceable: oral
contract, Burton rejected that agreement by declining ‘the ptoposed term sheet unless and until
Adams found a lead investor to set the: term: The question then became whether a second
eriforceabie express otal contract was formed thereafter, i¢.,, of whether the parties’ course of
conduct manifested a new implied-in-fact contract when Adams accepted Burton's financed flight
te San Francisco to “pitch Uniswap to Paradigm.”

This-Court now finds that even if such conduct suggested.a potential new implied-in-fact
agreement, that new agreement would again be too indefinite to give rise to an enforceable
contract. There has. been no suggestion that Plaintiff will ‘be able, after discovery, to show proof
of key material terms, and it would agaiti anticipate future approval, preparation and execution of
documents. ‘In brief, Plaintiff has-provided no hint of a prospective basis or standard for deciding
whether the-agreement had been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy. (Kofchins v Evolution
Mkts, Inc., 3.1 NY3d 100, 73 NYS3d 319 [2018]; Foros Advisor LLC y Digital Globe, Inc. 333 F
Supp3d 354, 360 [SDNY 2018]; 7. Groppa Pools, Ine. y Massello, 106 AD3d 722, 712 [2d Dept

2013]; Schuckman Realty v Marine Midland Bank, 244 .D2d_400,.401 [2d Dept 1997)]).

B. ‘Statute of Frauds and the
Doffman Exceptiori

Adams further argued.that contract formation was. prohibited by New York's “Statute of Frauds,”
codified in General Obligations Law Sections 5-701 and 5-703, which provides, with many exceptions, that
cerlain agreements, promises, or undertakings are void unless in writing, Section 5-701(a) applies the
Statute of Frauds to “a contract to. pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a... business:
opportunity, business, ... or an friterest therein ..:” Burton argues, however, that he also “spent countless
hours in front-of a whiteboard” providing Adams with “technical and design advice” when “the Uniswap
protocol and project were still in proof'of concept form.”

In Dorfinan v Refki, 144 AD 34 10, 16, 19 ¢ Ist Dept 2016) (“Dorfman”), the First Department
noted that the services therein, where not merely “developing: materials. to secure investor backing,
recruiting engineers,” but further “develop[ed] the details of how [the company’s] software. . . would be
‘architected,”” and accordingly found that. they consisted of more thar just assisting in the negotiation or
corisuimmation of the business opportunity. ‘Thus, the First Department ruled that the oral agreement therein:
was not void pursuant to Section 5-701 (ay(l 0). |

Here, however, even ‘if the Derfinan exception applied, and the agreement was not void per se
pursuant to. New York’s “Statute. of Frauds, i¢ would still suffer fiom the same uncertainty. and. rejection-
of-offer-issues that precluded it from being deemed an enforceable contract.

C. Unjust Enrichment, Quantum Meruit, and
Reasonable Value of Services.

Under New York law, guaritum meruit.and unjust enrichment are not separate causes of
action and are therefore andlyzed under the same principles (Assoc. Morte. Bankers, Inc. v
Calcon Mut. Morte. LEC, 159 F Supp 3d 324, 33 7 [EDNY 2016]. As noted in the Juterim
Decision, inorder to set forth acclaim in quantum meruil, a plaintiff must establish (1) the
performance of the services in good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person:to

whont they are renderéd, (3) an éxpectation of compensation, anid (4) the reasonable value of the

6 of 8
INDEX NO. 506967/2021

services (see, e.g., Mirance Contracting, Inc, v Perel,’57 AD3d 956, 871 NYS2d 310 [2d Dept
2008); Geraldi y-Melamid, 212 AD2d 575, 622 NYS2d 742 [2d Dept 1995]; Tesser v Allboro:
Equip. Co., 302 AD2d 589, 590, 756 NYS2d 253, asd [2d Dept 2003]. An unjust enrichment
claims rooted in “the equitable principle that a person shall not be-allowed to enrich himself
unjustly-at the expense of another” (Miller v Schloss, 218 N.Y. 400, 407, 113 N.E. 337 [1916]),
and a viable claim merely tequires that the plaintiff allege “that (1) the other party was enriched,
(2) at.that party's expense, and.(3) that it is against equity and good conscience to permit the
other party to retain what is sought to be recovered” (Mandarin Trading Lid. v Wildenstein, 16
NY3d 173, 182, 919 NYS2d 465. The Jnterim Decision noted that the pleadings herein were
sufficient to establisti the first three of those-elements of an unjust enrichment claim, at least for
purposes of defeating the instant dismissal motion, but granted the parties leave to brief the issue.
of calculating the “reasonable value of services” in connection with assisting.a cryptocurrency
startup, with respect to unjust enrichment and. quantum meruit claims.”

Without a contract to govern. the terms of payment for services, Adams argues that the
measure of compensation is generally.based.on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the number
of hours of services (see; ¢.g., Carlino v Kaplan. 139 F Supp2d 563, 566 [SDNY 2001]; Wong v.
Michael Kennedy, P.C., 853 F Supp 73, 81-82 [EDNY 1994]. There are, however, exceptions.
where, even absent a.contract, industry conventions dictate that the value of sérvices may be based

upon the value of the product. The question presented was whether the facts and/or industry

5 The Interim Decision rejected Defendant argument that Plaintiff could not plead quasi contract and breach
of contract in the alternative, where as here there is a bora fide disputé as to the existence of a contract
(Polley v Plainsinin Corp., 8. AD2d 638, 186 NYS2d 295 [2d Dept 1959]; Krigsfeld v Feldman, 115 AD3d.
712, 982 NYS2d 487 [2d Dept 2014]; 444 Sales, Ine. v Creative Bath. Products, Ine., 58 AD3d 6, 867
NYS2d 169 [2d Dept 2008]).

conventions within the start-up field, or perhaps more. specifically emerging cryptocurrency field,
where-vast fortunes may be made or lost, warrant such an exception.

At stake is the'difference between the Complaint’s allegations of Burton’s ‘provision of services”
and funds totaling $25,000, versus his claim for $100 million in “restitution” under unjust enrichment or
quantum meruit theories. There remains a question of fact whether the “reasonable value” of services
should be limited to a calculation based upon hours and costs purportedly spent (Collins Tuttle -& Co. v.
Leucadia, inc., 153 AD2d: 526,526. [1st Dept 1989]; Hindsight Sots., LEC v-Citigtoup Inc., 53. F Supp 3d
747, 776-77 [SDNY 2014]; Caribbean Direct, inc. v Dubset ELC, 100 A.D3d 510, 511 [1st Dept 2012]),.
or whether in fact industry standards, and/or the parties discussions or conduct reflects some other
reasonable value of services. The parties will procéed with discovery on this narrowed issue. Burton
argues that $100-million is the’ reasonable value of his roughly $25,000 in cash. and. critical
developmental support. The parties: shall proceed with discovery. on that issue of whether their
industry and/or their communications or conduct support a finding consistent or inconsistent with
that argument.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT1
Plaintiff Richard Burton (“Burton”) is disgruntled that he chose not to invest
early in a company that turned out to be a great financial success and seeks to use the
court system to go back in time to create an investment contract that does not exist.
Despite being unable to allege facts in the Complaint to establish the existence of an
agreement with defendant Hayden Adams (“Adams”), Burton argues that he is entitled
to a “lost opportunity” contract-based measure of damages worth around $100 million
under all three of his claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment and quantum
meruit. Yet, Burton has not identified specific facts in his opposition that would
establish the existence of an enforceable agreement, nor does the law permit Burton to
use quasi-contract claims to obtain contract-based damages.
Burton’s first claim for breach of contract claim fails because he has not alleged
that the parties reached agreement on definite and certain contract terms. The “oral
contract” pleaded in Paragraph 17 of the Complaint – i.e., that Burton promised to
provide “assistance” and Adams promised to give Burton an “ability to be an early
investor” – is too vague to enforce and leaves material terms such as the exact timing of
any investment and a purchase price open for future negotiations. Burton does not
contend otherwise. Instead, in an attempt to establish that the parties reached an
enforceable agreement, Burton’s opposition cobbles together scattered factual
1 All capitalized terms are defined in the Memorandum of Law in Support of
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, Dkt. No. 11 (the “Opening Brief”). Some
terms are redefined herein for the Court’s convenience.

allegations from events that took place after there was a supposed agreement. (See
Opposition (“Opp.”), Dkt. No. 13 at 6 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 26, 30).) Even then, the
Complaint still fails to plead facts showing that the parties reached agreement on when
Burton would be able to invest, a purchase price, and other essential terms.2 The
Complaint does not describe the terms of the unsigned term sheet that Adams allegedly
gave to him, does not allege that Adams agreed that Burton could wait until a lead
investor was found to jump on the train and invest himself, and does not allege how a
lead investor would set the terms and price of a deal between Burton and Adams. As
the authority in Adams’ Opening Brief establishes (which Burton largely ignores), the
Complaint’s allegations are legally insufficient to establish the existence of an
enforceable agreement or a breach.
Burton’s quasi-contract claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit also
fail. Though a “plaintiff is entitled to plead inconsistent causes of action in the
alternative” (Winick Realty Grp. LLC v. Austin & Assocs., 51 A.D.3d 408, 408 (1st Dep’t
2008) (italics added)), this rule does not permit a plaintiff, like Burton, to use equitable
causes of action as a vehicle to duplicate a legal claim for breach of contract. But that is
what Burton seeks to do here. Burton improperly attempts to use equitable doctrines to
enforce an otherwise unenforceable agreement to agree. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 33, 44, 49,
53; Opp. at 11.) And rather than limit his purported damages to the reasonable value of
2 Among other things, Burton— presumably attempting to keep his options open— still
does not state in his opposition if Adams promised him shares in a future company or if
he was promised tokens or other digital assets associated with the Uniswap technology.
Nor does Burton identify any other interests or rights that he was or was not promised.

his services, Burton admits that he seeks a “lost opportunity” contract-based measure of
damages totaling $100 million based on the exact same facts as his contract claim. (See
Opp. at 11 (asserting that the “reasonable value of Mr. Burton’s services is the early
investment opportunity that is described in the Complaint—that is, investing $100,000
in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation”).) As pleaded, Burton’s claims for unjust
enrichment and quantum meruit merely duplicate his contract claim and should be
dismissed.
Nothing Burton has argued salvages the Complaint. This Court should dismiss
it in its entirety and not permit leave to amend.
ARGUMENT
I. Burton’s Breach of Contract Claim Should Be Dismissed
Burton has not met his burden of alleging the existence of an enforceable contract
with “sufficiently certain and specific” terms. See Balco Dev. Corp. v. Peters, 276 A.D.2d
729, 729 (2d Dep’t 2000) (citations omitted). Regardless of the contract theory, Burton
has failed to adequately allege an agreement or a breach.
A. The “Oral Contract” Alleged in Paragraph 17 Is an Unenforceable
Agreement to Agree
Burton has not alleged in the Complaint – and does not argue in his opposition –
that the parties reached an agreement on specific contract terms in the spring of 2018
when they allegedly made the oral contract. Even assuming Burton promised at that
time to provide “assistance” and Adams promised to give Burton an “ability to be an
early investor” (Compl. ¶ 17), those promises are far too vague and indefinite to enforce

in court. See, e.g., Brembo, S.P.A. v. T.A.W. Performance LLC, 176 A.D.3d 535, 536 (1st
Dep’t 2019); Kunica v. St. Jean Financial, Inc., 1998 WL 437153, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1998)
(claim for breach is insufficient when the complaint “is silent with respect to the amount
of stock options [plaintiff] is to be awarded, the exercise price of the stock options or the
date on which [plaintiff] could exercise the options.”)
Burton does not seriously debate this, but instead, asserts the red herring
argument that he did plead “the kinds of support that Mr. Burton provided to Mr.
Adams in the form of advice and money[.]” (See Opp. at 6.) But the Complaint’s
allegations that Burton provided Adams with money and other assistance do not
establish the existence of a contract – i.e., a legally enforceable promise to provide that
support.3 The Complaint nowhere alleges that the parties bargained over and reached
agreement on the scope of Burton’s services in the spring of 2018 or at any other time,
rendering it hopelessly vague. The Complaint’s vague and indefinite promises to
“provide assistance” in Paragraph 17 do not provide any “basis or standard for
deciding whether the agreement had been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy” and
thus are legally insufficient to state a claim for breach of contract. See Foros Advisor LLC
v. Digital Globe, Inc., 333 F. Supp. 3d 354, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).
3 At most, the Complaint may establish that the parties exchanged gratuitous promises,
which are not legally enforceable. See Startech, Inc. v. VSA Arts, 126 F. Supp. 2d 234,
236–37 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“when it is clear from the face of the pleading and terms of the
contract that a promise is gratuitous, the complaint will be dismissed”); Citibank, Nat’l
Assoc. v. London, 526 F. Supp. 793, 803 (S.D. TX 1981) (“in order for a promise to be
enforceable as a contract, the promise must be supported by valid consideration”);
Municipal Grocery Stores, Inc. v. Eastern Milk & Cream Co., Inc., 233 A.D. 764 (2d Dep’t
1931) (a promise or performance of a clearly gratuitous act is not good consideration).

B. Burton’s Other Allegations Fail to Establish the Existence of an
Agreement or a Breach
Unable to establish specific terms for the oral contract in Paragraph 17, Burton
instead argues that the “particulars of the investment opportunity [were] based on the
term sheet that Mr. Adams gave Mr. Burton” at a later time. (Opp. at 6 (italics added).)4
This argument is meritless for multiple reasons.
First, the Complaint does not describe any of the specific terms in the term sheet.
Nor did Burton attach a copy of the term sheet to his Complaint or to his opposition.
Thus, Burton has not met his burden.
Second, even assuming Burton could produce a (draft and unsigned) term sheet,
the Complaint does not allege facts showing that the parties signed or mutually agreed
on the term sheet. Paragraph 26 alleges that Burton responded to the term sheet by
expressing a “desire and intention to invest when Mr. Adams had found a lead investor
to set the terms and price the deal.” If anything, this allegation demonstrates that the
parties had not reached any agreement at that time.
Third, Burton’s argument that “the parties agreed that Mr. Burton would invest
‘when Mr. Adams had found a lead investor to set the terms and price the deal‘”
misquotes his own Complaint. (See Opp. at 6 (citing Compl. ¶ 26).) Paragraph 26 states
that Burton expressed the desire to invest at a later time “when Mr. Adams had found a
4 Notably, Burton’s argument that a lead investor would set the price, or that the price
was later agreed to via a “term sheet” prove that the oral contract alleged in Paragraph
17 was nothing more than an unenforceable agreement to agree. See New York Military
Academy v. New Open Group, 142 A.D.3d 489, 490 (2d Dep’t 2016).

lead investor to set the terms and price the deal.” The Complaint nowhere alleges that
Adams agreed that Burton could invest on the same terms as a future lead investor. At
most, the Complaint alleges that “Adams agreed that Mr. Burton would have the ability
to be an early investor” (Compl. ¶ 17), and that Adams allegedly “assure[d]” Burton in
the summer of 2018 that he would be given “an opportunity to be an early investor if
and when a lead investor for the Uniswap project was identified.” (Id. ¶ 25.) Even
assuming these facts to be true, they do not establish that the parties had mutually
agreed that a lead investor would set the terms of Burton’s opportunity. Further, the
Complaint does not allege that he provided any consideration for an opportunity to
invest on the same terms as a lead investor.5
Fourth, the Complaint’s vague assertion that a lead investor would “set the terms
and price the deal” (id. ¶ 26) does not provide an objective measure to determine a
purchase price or any other specific contract terms. Burton does not allege – and does
not argue in his opposition – that the parties agreed on a formula or any other
methodology that would be used by them or a lead investor to set the terms of a deal
with Burton. In the absence of an objective measure to determine the contract terms,
Burton has not alleged an enforceable agreement. See Grasso v. Donnelly-Schoffstall, 2021
WL 1224052, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2021).
5 To the contrary, Burton alleges he provided Adams with money and personal
assistance pursuant to the prior “oral contract described [] in paragraph 17” that was
entered into the spring of 2018. (Compl. ¶ 19; see also ¶¶ 23, 29.)

Finally, the Complaint’s barebones allegation in Paragraph 30 that “Adams
initially agreed to allow Mr. Burton to invest in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation for
$100,000” does not save his claim, as notice pleading standards provide safeguards
against this type of elusive pleading. None of the factual allegations in the Complaint
support the conclusory assertions in Paragraph 30. The Complaint does not allege
when Adams allegedly agreed to allow Burton to invest $100,000 at a $10 million
valuation, whether that agreement was part of the alleged “oral contract,” or, if part of
the alleged term sheet, whether the term sheet included a purchase price at $100,000.
“The allegations of the pleading cannot be vague and conclusory (citations omitted), but
must contain sufficiently particularized allegations from which a cognizable cause of
action reasonably could be found.” V. Groppa Pools, Inc. v. Massello, 106 A.D.3d 722, 712
(2d Dep’t 2013); see also Schuckman Realty v. Marine Midland Bank, 244 A.D.2d 400, 401
(2d Dep’t 1997) (dismissing interference with contract claim when “the allegations in
support of this cause of action are devoid of a factual basis and are vague and
conclusory”); McNeary v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 286 A.D.2d 522, 524 (3d Dep’t
2001) (a “conclusory characterization” that there was a valid contract is insufficient).
Burton does not state a claim for breach of contract under any theory, warranting
dismissal of the breach of contract claim with prejudice.
C. Burton Concedes that the Statute of Frauds Bars Any Contract Claims
Based on Plaintiff’s “Know How” or “Know Who”
This Court should rule that the statute of frauds bars Burton’s contract claim to
the extent it is based on allegations that Burton helped Adams “pitch to prospective

11 of 17
8
investors” and “did whatever possible to help [Adams] connect with the right people to
work and partner with[.]” (Compl. ¶¶ 20-21.) Though Burton denies that these
allegations “contemplate[] the use of Mr. Burton’s ‘know how’ or ‘know who’ to
facilitate investments” (Opp. at 3),6 the Complaint repeatedly suggests that Burton’s
contract claim is based at least in part on assistance that Burton provided to identify,
pitch, or otherwise facilitate investments and the capitalization of the company. (See
Compl. ¶¶ 20-21, 27, 38.)
Moreover, Burton’s reliance on Dorfman to argue his claim is not subject to the
statute of frauds is misplaced. In Dorfman v. Refkin, 144 A.D. 3d 10, 16, 19 (1st Dep’t
2016), the court held that the alleged services, “including developing materials to secure
investor backing, recruiting engineers and others to [the company], and developing the
details of how [the company’s] software . . . would be ‘architected,’” consisted of more
than just assisting in the negotiation or consummation of the business opportunity and
thus did not fall within Section 5-701(a)(10). However, unlike in Dorfman, the
Complaint’s allegations of “advice and personal assistance” do not rise to the level of
the “technical support” that extend beyond the reach of the statute of frauds. In fact,
the Complaint’s allegations plainly describe his efforts to negotiate the business
opportunity by helping Adams “pitch to prospective investors” and by doing
6 Notably, the argument that his claims rest on the “use of Mr. Burton’s dollars” (See
Opp. at 8) rather than his services is fatal to his quantum meruit claim. See Skillgames,
LLC v. Brody, 1 A.D.3d 247, 251 (1st Dep’t 2003) (affirming dismissal of quantum meruit
claim and stating that the claim does not apply “to the provision of money rather than
services”).

“whatever possible to help [Adams] connect with the right people to work and partner
with[.]” (Compl. ¶¶ 20-21.) Any argument by Burton that these allegations form the
basis for the consideration he provided to Adams in accordance with the alleged
agreement place the contract within the statute of frauds.
II. Burton’s Equitable Claims Should Be Dismissed
A. Burton’s Request for Contract Damages Leaves No Doubt He is Using
the Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit Claims in an Attempt to
Enforce an Unenforceable Contract
Although Burton asserts that his quasi-contract claims may be pleaded in the
alternative and “exist to fill the vacuum and provide Mr. Burton a remedy” in the
absence of a contract (Opp. at 5, 9), unjust enrichment and quantum meruit cannot be
used to duplicate a contract claim or enforce an otherwise unenforceable agreement to
agree. See Doller v. Prescott, 167 A.D.3d 1298, 1301 (3d Dep’t 2018) (affirming dismissal
of contract claim as an unenforceable agreement to agree and holding that “‘[a]n unjust
enrichment claim is not available where it simply duplicates, or replaces, a conventional
contract or tort claim.”)
Burton does not distinguish Doller or any of the other cases in Adams’ Opening
Brief that establish that equitable claims cannot be used to duplicate a contract claim or
enforce an otherwise unenforceable contract. (See Opening Brief at 14-17.) Nor does
Burton cite any authority to support his legally erroneous argument that he can seek a
“lost opportunity” contract-based measure of damages based on the exact same facts as
his contract claim through quasi-contract theories. (See Opp. at 11 (asserting, without
any legal support, that the “reasonable value of Mr. Burton’s services is the early
FILED: KINGS COUNTY CLERK 08/20/2021 04:36 PM INDEX NO. 506967/2021

13 of 17
10
investment opportunity that is described in the Complaint—that is, investing $100,000
in Uniswap at a $10 million valuation”).)
The Complaint’s allegations regarding Burton’s ‘provision of services’ and funds
totaling $25,000 do not plausibly support a claim for $100 million in restitution under
unjust enrichment or quantum meruit theories. (See Compl. ¶¶ 19-24, 27.) “Recovery
on a claim premised upon quasi-contract or unjust enrichment is limited to
the reasonable value of the services rendered by the plaintiff[.]” Collins Tuttle & Co. v.
Leucadia, Inc., 153 A.D.2d 526, 526 (1st Dep’t 1989). The “reasonable value” of services
provided must be calculated on a reasonable basis, such as “hours purportedly spent”
(Hindsight Sols., LLC v. Citigroup Inc., 53 F. Supp. 3d 747, 776–77 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)), “cost
estimates” for developing a project (Caribbean Direct, Inc. v. Dubset, LLC, 100 A.D.3d 510,
511 (1st Dep’t 2012)), or a record acknowledging fees owed for work purportedly
performed. Moses v. Savedoff, 96 A.D.3d 466, 471 (1st Dep’t 2012) (relying on “emails
purportedly sent by defendant to plaintiff acknowledging that defendant owes plaintiff
certain fees” to calculate reasonable value of services).
Because Burton’s second and third causes of action merely duplicate his first
cause of action for breach of contract, they should be dismissed as a matter of law. See
Doller, 167 A.D.3d at 1301; Akerson Advertising & Marketing, Inc. v. St. John & Partners
Advertising, 89 F. Supp. 3d 341, 345-46 (N.D.N.Y. 2015) (dismissing equitable claims
when plaintiff “clearly seeks the benefit of the bargain.”)

B. Burton Has Not Sufficiently Alleged the “Services” that He Performed
While Burton argues that the Complaint “identifies with specificity the services
that Mr. Burton performed,” this is simply not true. (See Opp. at 10.) At best, the
Complaint describes the services allegedly performed by Burton in a vague and
conclusory manner, all masked in the form of “services,
” including ambiguous activities
such as: “thinking through a project” while “spen[ding] countless hours in front of a
whiteboard” (Compl., ¶ 20), “doing whatever was possible to help [Defendant] connect
with the right people to work and partner with” (id., ¶ 21), and “providing technical,
financial and other assistance[.]” (Id., ¶ 45.) This is fatal. “Because plaintiff[] ha[s] set
forth no more than vague and conclusory allegations regarding what services [he]
provided to defendants or what the reasonable value for these services was, [he] ha[s]
failed to state a claim for quantum meruit.” Desilva v. North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health System, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 2d 497, 535 (E.D.N.Y. 2011). Further, the Complaint’s
inadequate description of the services that Burton allegedly performed certainly falls far
short of supporting his allegation that the reasonable value of his services is $100
million. (See supra at II.A.)
Because Burton fails to meet his burden of pleading the services that he provided
and the reasonable value of those services, the Complaint’s quantum meruit claim
should be dismissed.
III. The Court Should Deny Burton Leave to Amend
Finally, this Court should deny Burton’s request for leave to amend. In
determining whether to grant leave, “the court must examine the underlying merits of

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 23 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/20/2021
15 of 17
12
the causes of action asserted . . . to do otherwise, would constitute a waste of judicial
resources.” Scott v. Bell Atl. Corp., 282 A.D.2d 180 (1st Dep’t 2001); see also Dionisio v.
George De Rue Contractors, Inc., 38 A.D.3d 1172, 1174 (4th Dep’t 2007) (denying leave to
amend where a proposed amendment plainly lacked merit.) Granting Burton’s request
to “incorporate the term sheet and written communications identified in Paragraph 26
of the Complaint” (see Opp. at 11-12)—a term sheet which Burton notably did not attach
to his Opposition—would not save his claims. See 25 Bay Terrace Ass’ns v. Pub. Serv.
Mut. Co., 144 A.D.3d 665, 667 (2d Dep’t 2016) (stating that in opposing a motion to
dismiss a complaint, plaintiff may submit other documents to remedy a defective
complaint.) Burton’s admissions already establish that the parties never reached an
enforceable agreement. (See supra at I.B.) Additionally, Burton cannot and should not
be permitted to use the equitable doctrines of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit to
pursue “lost opportunity” or any other contract-based damages.
CONCLUSION
A review of the Complaint and Burton’s opposition makes clear that Burton is
not able to plead a breach of contract because it is hopelessly indefinite and uncertain.
Burton’s other claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit also do not pass
muster because they are merely seeking to enforce an otherwise unenforceable contract.
The motion to dismiss should be granted (Dkt. No. 10), and the Complaint’s three
causes of action—breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit—should
be dismissed with prejudice.
