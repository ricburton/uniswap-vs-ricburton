RICHARD BURTON,
Plaintiff, Index No. 506967/2021
DECISION & ORDER
: Hon. Larry D. Martin
HAYDEN ADAMS,
Defendant.
>< i

Plaintiff RICHARD BURTON commenced this action against Defendant HAYDEN
ADAMS, founder and chief executive officer of Universal Navigation, Inc. (“Universal”), seeking
i
$100 million in damages for breach of contract, and, in the alternative, restitution for unjust
enrichment sounding in quantum meruit in connection with Plaintiffs role in developing
““Uniswap,’ a multi-billion-dollar . . . software and crypto¢urrency enterprise used to trade
i
cryptocurrency and digital assets.” Defendant moves to dismiss the complaint (Seq. No. 1)
pursuant to CPLR § 3211. |
Background |
A. Cryptocurrency
Each unit of cryptocurrency, “virtual or digital money,” is either called a “coin” or a
“token.” Coins—the most notable of which is Biteoin—have a stated or discernible monetary
value! The terms coins (or “convertible coins”) and “tokens” are often used interchangeably,

|
however, tokens are better thought of as “digital assets” that may “fluctuate in value as any

commodity would.” Sec. and Exch. Commn. v Telegram Grp Ine., 448 F Supp 3d 352, 358 (SDNY

2020). As a practical matter, both coins and tokens are cryptocurrency that "may be used to pay

for goods or services[] or held for investment."?

Cryptocurrencies operate, via a record-keeping technology called “blockchain,” which

conspicuously (i.e., viewable by anyone) and permanently stores every transaction. Bitcoin is just
one of several cryptocurrencies. | Another cryptocurrency, “Ether,” operates on the “Ethereum”

blockchain.

Cryptocurrency transactions may occur directly between parties via “decentralized
cryptocurrency exchanges” (DEX), which allow users to trade one cryptocurrency for another, or

for traditional currencies such as US. dollars.3

B. Factual Background

Since the Court is bound to accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true (Leon v
Martinez, 84 NYS2d 83, 87, 614 NYS2d 972 [1994]), Plaintiff Burton is a software developer,
designer and entrepreneur, and the founder of “Balance,” an Ethereum blockchain wallet startup.
Defendant Adams is founder and CEO of “Uniswap,” a DEX software that improves the
functionality of trading on the Ethereum platform. While Uniswap bills itself as the largest DEX
on Ethereum, when the parties met in 2018, Uniswap was “little more than an idea.”

Burton allowed Adams to Work on Uniswap daily in Balance’s offices, spending “countless
hours in front of a whiteboard,” helping Adams think through the project and pitch the project to
prospective investors, all in the hopes of financially benefitting. In addition to technical and design

advice, Burton, knowing Adams was running low on funds, also supplied him $25,000 for software

development, rent, and other costs.

NYSCEF DOC, NO, 24 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

Burton alleges that, “[a]s consideration for [Burton’s] assistance,” they agreed he would
have the ability to be an early investor in Uniswap, and that, <pjut for” such agreement, Burton
would not have provided the support that he offered to, and that was accepted by, Adams. It is
undisputed that, at some point thereafter, Adams offered Burton a deal “a term sheet,” and that
Burton confirmed his continued interest in investing, indicating he would only do so after Adams
had found a “lead investor to set the terms and price the deal.” Burton thereafter financed Adams’s
flight to San Francisco to “pitch Uniswap to Paradigm, a well-known blockchain focused venture
i
capital firm.” Paradigm went on to seed $1 million into Adams’s then still-unincorporated

enterprise, now Universal, at a $10 million valuation.

The Complaint alleges that, since then, and as a product of Burton’s assistance, Uniswap

has seen a major increase in trading, processing over $110 billion in volume, and “increasing to

the tune of more than $1 billion daily.”

C. Arguments

Burton argues the foregoing facts set forth a prima facie case that the parties entered an
oral “contract,” whereby he would be given the opportunity to invest in Uniswap once it took a
“concrete” form into which an investment could be made, and that this contract is supported by
Adams’s assurances provided “in writing, in person and on voice-calls.” Burton commenced the
instant action after Adams rejected his post-Paradigm $100,000 investment proffer, alleging
breach of contract, or alternatively, unjust enrichment. Burton argues that $100 million is the

reasonable value of his $25,000 cash and critical developmental support, enabling Adams to be

enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 RECELVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

Adams disputes Burton’s characterizations and seeks to limit Burtons claim sounding in
quantum meruit to $25,000 in addition to something akin to an hourly breakdown of the
“reasonable value” of Burton’s services.

| Discussion
A. Contract Claim

The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) formation of a contract
between plaintiff and defendant, 2) performance by plaintiff, (3) defendant's failure to perform,
(4) resulting damage (Riccio v Genworth Fin., 184 AD3d 590, 124 NYS3d 370 [2d Dept 2020]).
The requirements for the formation of a contract are (1) at least two parties with legal capacity to
contract, (2) mutual assent to the terms of the contract, and (3) consideration (Restatement
[Second] of Contracts §§ 9, 12, 23). The first step in considering whether a contract was formed
is to determine if there was a sufficiently definite offer such that its unequivocal acceptance would
have given rise to an enforceable contract (Kolchins v Evolution Mkts., Inc., 31 NY3d 100, 73
NYS3d 519 [2018]). This determination must be made looking to the objective manifestations of
the parties’ intents (Utica Builders, LLC v Collins, 176 AD3d 897, 899, 110 NYS3d 49, 51-52 [2d
Dept 2019}), bearing in mind that assent may take the form of written or spoken words (express
contract) or conduct manifesting hgreement (contract implied-in-fact) (Miller v Schloss, 218 NY
400, 113 NE 337 [1916]).* |

As a general rule, if an acceptance is qualified with conditions, it is treated as a rejection

and counteroffer (Roer v Cross Coty. Med. Ctr. Corp., 83 AD2d 861, 441 NYS2d 844 [2d Dept

1981]). Specifically, where material terms are left for future negotiations, courts consider it merely

4 A binding contract may also be formed by the oral acceptance of a written contract (Mor v Fastow, 32
AD3d 419, 819 NYS2d 560 [2d Dept 2006]; Morton 's of Chicago/Great Neck LLC v Crab House, Inc.,
297 AD2d 335, 746 NYS2d 317 [2d Dept 2002]).

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 i RECEIVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

i

an agreement to agree and, therefore, unenforceable (4/0 BPR Corp. v Chmelecki Asset Mgmt.,
Inc., 51 AD3d 715, 859 NYS2d 209 [2d Dept 2008]). This is true when an agreement contains
open terms, calls for future approval, and expressly anticipates future preparation and execution
of contract documents (Carmon v Soleh Boneh Ltd., 206 AD2d 450, 450, 614 NYS2d 555, 556
[2d Dept 1994]). There, courts operate with a strong presumption against finding a binding and

enforceable obligation (id).

Here, Plaintiff alleges that the parties agreed that he would be given the opportunity to
invest in Uniswap, if, when, or once Uniswap “took a concrete form into which investment could
be made.” Accordingly, any purported “agreement” was unenforceable because it was qualified
with conditions, devoid of material terms, expressly anticipating future approval, preparation, and

i
execution of contract documents. The Court, therefore, finds that the parties do not have a binding
and enforceable contract. |

To the extent that Plaintiff maintains that agreement was supported by Defendant’s

t

assurances provided “in writing, in person and on voice-calls,” New York’s “Statute of Frauds,

i

codified in General Obligations Law Sections 5-701 and 5-703, provides, with many exceptions,

that certain agreements, promises, or undertakings are void unless in writing. Most relevant here,

section 5-701(a) applies the Statute of Frauds to “a contract to pay compensation for services

rendered in negotiating a . . . business opportunity, business, i . .or-an. interest therein... .”5

Accordingly, such writings are material. Here, however, the only writings referenced are. the

|

> Inacommercial context, courts sometime look at partial performance as an indicia of an agreement even
without writing, and indeed, New York’s Commercial Code, dealing with transactions between
merchants, has a specific section addressing the practical business reality of transactions between a
buyer and a seller (see § 2-201). Plaintiff has not suggested, however, that the underlying transaction
was between commercial entities. ;

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 24 RECELVED NYSCEF: 12/21/2021

foregoing term sheet and emails, which, for the reasons previously stated, do not suggest the
existence of a contract.
B. Duplicative Claim
Contrary to Defendant’s allegations, it is well established that quasi contract and breach of
contract claims may be pleaded jointly and that a party is not precluded from proceeding on both
breach of contract and quasi-contractual theories where there is a bona fide dispute as to the
existence of a contract (see Polley v Plainshun Corp., 8 AD2d 638, 186 NYS2d 295 [2d Dept
1959]; Krigsfeld v Feldman, 115 AD3d 712, 982 NYS2d 487 [2d Dept 2014]; AHA Sales, Inc. v
Creative Bath Products, Inc., 58 AD3d 6, 867 NYS2d 169 [2d Dept 2008]). The action is
predicated on an obligation the law creates precisely in the absence of an agreement (Pappas v
Tzolis, 20 NY3d 228, 958 nvs2d 656 [2012]; Goldman v Metro. Life Ins. Co., 5 NY3d 561, 807
NYS2d 583 [2005]; Georgia Malone & Co., Inc. v Rieder, 19 NY3d 511, 950 NYS2d 333 [2012]).
C. Quantum Meruit |
In order to make out a claim in quantum meruit, a plaintiff must establish (1) the
performance of the services in good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person to whom
they are rendered, (3) an expectation of compensation, and (4) the reasonable value of the services
(Miranco Contracting, Inc. v Perel, 57 AD3d 956, 871 NYS2d 310 [2d Dept 2008]; Tesser v
Allboro Equip. Co., 302 AD2d 589, 590, 756 NYS2d 253, 254 [2d Dept 2003]; Geraldi v Melamid,
212 AD2d 575, 622 NYS2d 742 [2d Dept 1995]).
Here, the pleadings are clearly sufficient to establish three of the four foregoing elements of
quantum meruit for purposes of defeating the motion, i.e., (1) the performance of the services in

good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person to whom they are rendered, and (3) an

expectation of compensation. What remains less clear is the proper standard for calculating the

“reasonable value of the services” within the context of a quantum meruit claim, and, specifically,
when and whether “other factors,” such as the amount of a defendant's enrichment should be
considered where, as here, there is no claim of misconduct, malfeasance, or statutory violation. In
the interest of justice, both sides should be afforded an opportunity to brief this Court on that issue.

Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to dismiss (Seq. No. 1) is granted solely to the extent of
granting both sides until January 16, 2022 to submit one further affirmation or memorandum of
law, narrowly focusing on arguments as to the proper standard of calculating the “reasonable value
of the services” with respect to a quantum meruit claim where no claim of misconduct,

malfeasance, or violation of a statue has been made.
