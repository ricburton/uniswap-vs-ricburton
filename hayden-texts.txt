Hayden Adams:
	Not sure what he means  by AMM, maybe on-chain market makers?
	He’s right that its better for small purchases
	At least while the contracts are at low liquidity levels
	I have a few ideas around price stabilization though especially for Uniswap 2.0
	Ohh automatic market makers

Richard Burton:
	That’s the one 

Hayden Adams:
	Im looking at implementing limit orders, where someone can send a transaction that says “here is 5 ETH, I need at least 100 OMG back
	And then if the price moves to where the user would get 101 omg back or something
	Someone else could execute on their behalf and claim a 1omg bounty
	Should prevent massive price swings due to low liquidity

Richard Burton:
	Interesting
	I’d love to connect you two

Hayden Adams:
	Yeah sure, he sounds like a smart guy 

Richard Burton:
	Just asked him
	Do you have a VPN?
	Wanna try our exchange functionality?

Hayden Adams:
	Hahha I do on my computer 

Richard Burton:
	nice
	Here’s the link when you’re on it
https://shapeshift--balance-manager.netlify.com/metamask

Hayden Adams:
	Awesome I’ll check it out when I’m back in bk 
	Why do I need a vpn?
	Will is the 0x guy right?

Richard Burton:
	Can’t use shapeshift in NY
	yep

Hayden Adams:
	Ohh haha right I forgot 

Richard Burton:
	That’s why need more unstoppable exchanges 😉
	Had an idea for a project that might interest you
	you would learn a shitload about liquidity
Hayden Adams:
	Awesome I’ll check it out when I’m back in bk 

Richard Burton:

https://github.com/balance-io/balance-manager/issues/204

Hayden Adams:
	I’ll read up on it tomorrow!
	And I think I’ll let you show me the shapeshift demo in person some time lol 

Richard Burton:
	😟 not curious?
	Our plan would be to plug it into your thing

Hayden Adams:
	Definitely curious 
	Haha just legally 
	Forgot about the shapeshift legal stuff 
	I’ll stop by the office again soon to check it out! 

Richard Burton:
	Ah ok 
	It’s no biggie 
	All going to be legal soon

Hayden Adams:
	I’ll read up on it tomorrow!

would be kind of crazy to make uniswap illegal 
Looks super nice and easy to use 
Should be real easy to integrate uniswap 

Hayden Adams:
	Have you heard of
	https://www.totle.com/
	Theyre doing some type of multi exchange integration thing and just sent me an email

Richard Burton:
	Looks solid 
	We view trading as a tiny party of what we want to do

	How’s it going?

Hayden Adams:
	Hey! It went well. Just did a 4 hour power walk with Karl and vitalik lol 

Richard Burton:
	Fantastic
	Jamming on a password reset protocol today from 12-3. Want to join us?

Hayden Adams:
	Might have to join part way through, but down to stop by 
https://twitter.com/Balance_io/status/1010914705353986048

Richard Burton:
	People are bailing for family stuff
	Might wonder in the park

Hayden Adams:
	Not sure I can walk in a park right now. Yesterday’s power walk went through all of morningside Park, Central Park, and riverside park and I can barely feel my legs

Richard Burton:
	I’m gonna buidl all afternoon 
	Come hammock any time after 2

Hayden Adams:
	Sounds good 
	I’ll be there 3ish

Richard Burton:
	Hi, I've sent you 0.01 eth.
To receive follow the link:
	https://eth2.io/#/r?p=18455582758&c=GDcspHMAGHcavyecHQB3
	Hey man. Jin was too tired to think today so I’ve decided to come back Saturday and not do the road trip. Need to help the team. Please come by the studio any time. I’ll ask Christian about getting you a key.

Hayden Adams:
	No worries man gotta put your team first. I have a tonnn if buidling to do over the next few weeks which is what I should be focusing on as well. 
	A key would be dope!

Hayden Adams:
	Cool yeah I’ve been following the Dutch exchange. It’s pretty interesting especially from a front running resistance standpoint. I believe purchases are not instantaneous which is where my market maker is most different. Very curious about their gas costs 

Richard Burton:
	Yeah that team ships 

Hayden Adams:
	Very smart people, very legit tech. Very very skeptical at their claims of “true decentralization by DAO governance” when 5% of their tokens were sold to the public and 95% were sold to the founders/private investors

Richard Burton:
	Oh for sure. That was the early days.
	They’ve got a ludicrous amount of capital
￼


Hayden Adams:
	Awesome :) 

Richard Burton:
	How are things?
	Wanna buidl tomorrow?

Hayden Adams:
	Hey! I’ve been good. Should be able to stop by tomorrow afternoon

Richard Burton:
https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1013206269983850497?s=12

Hayden Adams:
	Very confused by the write up lol
	“Rather than use an Ethereum Token or a new blockchain to facilitate Atomic-Swap trades between users, the proposed system would use a client-server system to match orders.”

Richard Burton:
	:)
	I thought so 

Hayden Adams:
	Almost all ethereum dex’s fit that description 
	Have to read more lol 

Richard Burton:
	I love the way you slice apart things

Hayden Adams:
	If it’s an off-chain order book for cross chain atomic swaps I like it. But their buzzword game is weak 😂

Richard Burton:
	lol
	Thank you 
	Just landed 

Hayden Adams:
	No problem, welcome back 

Richard Burton:
	At Toby’s estate 

Hayden Adams:
	Who’s Toby again? 

Richard Burton:
	Haha sorry 
	The cafe 
	With will 
	Then back to studio 

Hayden Adams:
	will from 0x?

Richard Burton:
	Mycrypto > Blockstack 

Hayden Adams:
	cool! I might just come buidl tomorrow instead

Richard Burton:
	Looking forward to seeing you

Hayden Adams:
	Yo btw showed early mockups of the next UX version last Wednesday!

Hayden Adams:
	Click v02 on the left side
	Approve button will really be a buy button
	Main reason I haven’t been cleaning up the website is because of how much will be redone near future
	the issues you opened are super helpful though might clean some up short term

Richard Burton:
	For sure
	Just tiny things
	I want to understand the product
	And what an integration with Balance would look like

Hayden Adams:
	V01 is lots soft of experimental. V02 is where we are iterating towards final version
	Def wallet connect stuff

Richard Burton:
	This is really cool

Hayden Adams:
	Thanks!
	most of the credit goes to cal
	yeah so my general idea of balance integration
	Is wallet connect support on my frontend, and exchange integration (like shapeshifter) in the balance wallet

Richard Burton:
	Love it
	Keen for that

Hayden Adams:
	I have a 3pm meeting. Planning on stopping by after

Hayden Adams:
	Meeting went a bit long 
	Omw

Richard Burton:
	At Victoria 
	Vittoria
	Stop by 
	Going to studio 

Hayden Adams:
	Cool I’ll be there in 10

Richard Burton:
	Our queen had some questions for you in slack 😅😅😅

Hayden Adams:
	You at the studio?

Richard Burton:
	Yep

Hayden Adams:
	Cool I have a thing at 7 nearby so I’m going to stop by until then 

Richard Burton:
	Want to do something for 4 July?

Hayden Adams:

Richard Burton:
	There’s a cool dude here doing some videos about balance. Stoked to meet Karl!

Hayden Adams:
	Cool! We’re just at glaze right near dig in 
	Also he’s totally relaxed and chill I was wrong about him coming back stressed and manic lol

￼


Hayden Adams:
	Cool! I’d guess it will be a few months at least before cryptoeconomics.study is finished enough for it 

Richard Burton:
	Kk we’ll find enough 

Hayden Adams:
	Btw Karl is a bit sensitive with  public promotional type stuff so maybe let me if you’re going to tweet anything about it 

Richard Burton:
	Oh yeah wouldn’t share publicly 
	Just wanted to make it happen 
	Just dharma crew

Hayden Adams:
	Cool yeah for see 

Richard Burton:
	Cos it will need some help from them 

Hayden Adams:
	Sure 
	He thinks it a good idea 
	How was their reaction?

Richard Burton:
	Stoked 


￼

Richard Burton:
You should be on this

Hayden Adams:
	Hey!
	What's up 

Richard Burton:
	Do you have Venmo?

Hayden Adams:
	Yeah i do 
	@HaydenAdams
	Why? 
	The ticket seller on Craigslist wants to be vendors? 
	Venmo'd

Richard Burton:
	All sorted! Buidling all afternoon if you wanna join 

Hayden Adams:
	Cool running some errands but might stop by after 

Richard Burton:
	Do you like deep house?
	https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-anjunadeep-edition/id879507964?mt=2&i=1000415702005

Hayden Adams:
	I don't listen to it much but I do sometimes enjoy it!
	Just downloaded the podcasts app so I'll save that one 
	Are you buidling at the studio today

Richard Burton:
	Yes come by 
	You’re always welcome 
	Unless Christian is fucking 
	That’s it 
	Night or day 

Hayden Adams:
	Well, I wasn’t sure if he was fucking

Richard Burton:
	Of course 
	He’s going to establish a signal 

Hayden Adams:
	how about a slack channel called ischristianfucking
	and then he just says yes or no to update the status

Richard Burton:
	ischristiansmanging
	Google smanging it

Hayden Adams:
	Lol just did
https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-anjunadeep-edition/id879507964?mt=2&i=1000415702005

Richard Burton:
	If you can convince Karl and Vitalik to come by tonight
	Unannounced 
	It would make my week 
	😍😍😍
	Tell those lads how hard we are working on the problems they care about 
	The community would be stoked 

Hayden Adams:
	V is actually not in NYC yet was told the wrong day 
	Karl might come 
	Talked to him yesterday
	Unannounced for sure if he does 

Richard Burton:
	sg
	Hey man
	Another request if possible:
	And also: while we don't want many more letters, one from Vitalik truly would be a significant addition.  May I take the liberty of preparing that, too!
	Gotta think about how to pitch it to him right
	This is my lawyer

Hayden Adams:
	What do you mean by letters?
	Ohhh you mean for your visa 

Richard Burton:
	Digging in

Hayden Adams:
	I'll keep it in mind and bring it up with Karl but no promises. vitalik related social capital is something I have very very  limited supply of right now 

Richard Burton:
	For sure
	I’ll ask Jon Choi 
	They need WalletConnect to be a success 
	It won’t be if I’m kicked out of US 

Hayden Adams:
	That's a good idea. Lmk how it goes with Jon 
	I can also ask Karl to talk to Jon if they're resistant 

Richard Burton:
	Jon’s fine signing 
	Just Vitalik would seal the deal 
	The nerdy cherry 🍒 

Hayden Adams:
	Did you get a signature from any stripe people? 

Richard Burton:
	Hell no lol
	But creator of like button lol

Hayden Adams:
	yo! I met someone from Rchain today. I have a meeting with him Monday to talk about funding to build a version of uniswap on their chain. He also mentioned that theyre looking for people to do a wallet if you guys are interested I could maybe bring him by

Richard Burton:
	Please do!

Hayden Adams:
	Totally agree. with regards to rchain and cosmos I'm mostly making the connections right now. My plan would be to not do any work on that stuff until after a successful mainnet ethereum  launch 
	Of uniswap 

Richard Burton:
	🖖

Hayden Adams:
	I don't think the balance research has been a distraction. I'm more worried about upcoming travel plans 

Richard Burton:
	Got it

https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-vs-withholding-forgery-combo-attack/2621

Richard Burton:
	Shots fired!

Hayden Adams:
	He's wrong 
	What he describes is only an attack on plasma map 
	Mvp 
	Between that and https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-is-an-useless-idea/2613/4 both which describe attacks on mvp I'm starting to think its an intentional FUD campaign

Richard Burton:
	Got it 
	How is our dear leader

Hayden Adams:
	He's good! 
	On my way over 

Richard Burton:
	If you’re getting some kind of smoothie 
	I’ll have one too 🍺

Hayden Adams:
	Any preference?

	Liquiman 
	shilllllling

Richard Burton:
	How are the illuminati

Hayden Adams:
	I’ll read through after my various initiations and sacrifices 
	It’s been good so far!

Richard Burton:
	No rush
	It won’t be of an academic standar
	lol
	standard
	But some fine shill nonethless
	nonetheless
	Can you find out if soho token labs is legit?

Hayden Adams:
	Yeah sure I’m down 

Richard Burton:

Richard Burton:
	How’s the closing process?

Hayden Adams:
	Good. Signed the term sheet. Got a lawyer. Now lawyers gotta do their thing for a bit lol 

Richard Burton:
	Want to meet Charlie and Jeff?
	They’re so fast 
	Been smashing our homepage 


Richard Burton:
	How much volume is coming through the interface vs other smart contract calls?

Hayden Adams:
	Yo
	Sorry been in meetings all day 
	I’m free now 
	Are they still there?
	If not can stop by tomorrow

Richard Burton:
	Yo 
	Still free

Hayden Adams:

	Proud of you 🦄

Hayden Adams:
	Gn! 

Richard Burton:
	Still curious: How much volume is coming through the interface vs other smart contract calls?
	UI vs API

Hayden Adams:
	Ohh right sorry 
	Hard to say haven’t had time to do analysis yet 
	I’d guess interface is maybe 25% idk though 

Richard Burton:
	Curious to know 
	When you have time 
	No rush 

Hayden Adams:
	Yeah def important analysis 
	Will let you know 

Richard Burton:
	How goes the swapping?

Hayden Adams:
	Good! How goes the balancing?

Richard Burton:
	Close the round?
	People are asking me how to get to you 

Hayden Adams:
	lol yeah i think word got out. I think whole raise is going to paradigm 
￼


Built this in swift 
In 3 days
Fuck react Native 

Hayden Adams:
	Seems like a pretty big move considering how much work has gone into the react app 

Richard Burton:
	I’ve had enough 
	The first 80% was great 
	The last 20% has been hell

Hayden Adams:
	So is the plan to move everything to Swift?

Richard Burton:
	For v2
	Anyway, let’s hang soon 
	Going to a meeting 

Hayden Adams:
	Sounds good
	Good luck!
	I’ll drop by the studio some time soon

Richard Burton:
	You should come tonight
	Lots of good people

Hayden Adams:
	It’s my birthday but I have some availability 
	What’s the timing 
	Coles event right?

Richard Burton:
	What’s the plan?
	Happy birthday 

Hayden Adams:
	Idk chilling with a friend later around 10
	Will be free around 3pm-10pm

Richard Burton:
	Nice man 
	16:30-17:30 hangs?

Hayden Adams:
	Where?
	Balance?
	Also what’s up with Stefan are you chilling with him? Would be cool to finally talk to someone from gnosis 

Richard Burton:
	I’m with home now 
	He wants to meet you 

Hayden Adams:
	Is that meant to be “I’m with him now” or “I’m at home now” lol

Richard Burton:
	Haha 
	I’m with him now 
	I’ll be home 15:00-17:30

Hayden Adams:
	Cool! I’m gonna come work out of balance for a bit 

Richard Burton:
	Sweet I’m resting as I didn’t sleep well 
	The pompcast was fun but I got so jacked for it 
	I need to wind down 

Hayden Adams:
	Yo
	Your friend Christine is at balance 

Richard Burton:
	Oh shot 
	My brain is melting 
	Be right over 
	Apologize on my behalf 
	I’m going to head to the event now 
	Want to join?

Hayden Adams:
	I’ll meet you there!

Richard Burton:
	Is there a Uniswap API?

Hayden Adams:
	For interacting with the contracts, docs.uniswap.io has most of what you need
	For historical data/analytics there’s another api in the works 
	But not ready yet 

Richard Burton:
	🖖
	Hey nan
	man
	Are you only letting paradigm do your round?
	If not, I’d love to invest.

Hayden Adams:
	Yeah only paradigm and to add more I think at this point 
	Appreciate the offer!
	*too late to 
	Will let you know if anything changes on that front though 

Richard Burton:
	Money is a fascinating substance.

Hayden Adams:
	That it is

Richard Burton:
	https://www.papertrophy.com/shop/us/wall-trophies/unicorn/unicorn-pink-white
	

	Hey man. I’m just going to say how I feel. I’m not happy. I put an insane amount of energy, time and money into to helping you last year and we had verbally and digitally agreed that you were going to let me invest. When you were flat broke I sent you what little money I could to keep you going.

If that is how you treat people who give you everything. I worry for how you will treat people who can give you nothing. Being a CEO is a lot harder than writing a smart contract.

You never performed any work for Balance. That $10k was for contracting.

I gave you $5k as a personal grant just to be helpful. 

I gave you $2.5k to help you *fly to San Francisco* so you could raise the money you needed.

I have had the worst period of my life with Balance recently and you have not asked me how I am.

I feel like money has changed you *already*. 

I am not making any demands about the investment. You do what is best for UniSwap. I am focusing on saving Balance.

I would like you to consider repaying Balance for the lack of any contracting and giving me my personal loan back. The grant was a grant. Keep it.

Richard
	Have you considered this message? I would like a response before the end of 2019.
	4 days

Hayden Adams:
	You don’t get to message me on New Year’s Eve demanding a response and then start counting down days.

Maybe try again with something like:

“Hey just wanted to bring this to your attention again. Would appreciate a response soon.”

Richard Burton:
	I have been waiting for 9 months. You don’t get to dictate anything, Hayden.

Hayden Adams:
	I get to dictate who I talk to and when. Don’t threaten me.

Richard Burton:
	I am not threatening. I am wrapping up my tax year.

Hayden Adams:
	Well I’m not sending you money in the next 4 days so no issues there 🤷‍♂️

Richard Burton:
	Good to know. That helps clarify things.

Hayden Adams:
	I’d be happy to hop on a call next Friday or some time the following week to talk about it.

Richard Burton:
	Friday 3rd January at 4pm EST works for me

Hayden Adams:
	Sent a calendar invite to i@rb.cm

Richard Burton:
	Ah I have shifted over to burtonic@gmail.com—thanks.

Hayden Adams:
	No problem, just updated the invite
	Haven’t forgotten btw. Still waiting on the contract from my lawyer
